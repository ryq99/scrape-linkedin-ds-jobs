AtoB,"Software Engineer, Risk",United States,"Software Engineer, Risk, AtoB, United States, Remote, 401(k) benefit, Hide job, Your profile matches this job, 3 days ago","Our mission

The trucking and logistics industry provides the backbone of the economy. But the payments infrastructure on which it runs is broken. For the hard-working men and women of this sector, the existing suite of payment tools is outdated, difficult to use, prone to fraud, and saddled with shady fee structures. The incumbent players in this space often overlook the economic and practical needs of this user base.

We're changing that. AtoB is building Stripe for Transportation — modernizing the payments infrastructure for trucking and logistics. Supply chains rely on the timely movement of capital to function efficiently. Our end game is a world in which that capital movement occurs fairly, smoothly, and without delay. As we pursue that end game, we aim to center our customers in every way — offering them world-class customer experience and building products that work with and around the unique constraints of their daily lives. We build for fleet managers in the office and drivers on the road. We strive for products that are efficient, satisfying, and useful. Our customers enable our modern economy — they deserve it.

Our history and background

Our founding team has backgrounds working on autonomous vehicles at Cruise Automation, leading ops and growth for Uber, building apps that were featured on the Apple app store, and completing other great projects. We have staff and senior engineers from Google, Uber, Meta, Shopify, etc.

We have raised over $100 million in venture capital from investors such as General Catalyst, Bloomberg Beta, Y Combinator; founders and CEOs of companies like Google (Eric Schmidt), Salesforce (Marc Benioff), Coinbase, DoorDash, Instacart, Mozilla, Wealthfront, Segment, Gusto, Figma; CxOs and founding team members of Uber, PayPal and Stripe; angels like Elad Gil, Naval Ravikant, Gokul Rajaram; and other funds such as Climate Capital, Contrary Capital, Collaborative Fund, Designer Fund, Human Capital, Leadout, XYZ Capital, among others.

We are excited to open up more seats in this rocket ship!

The Risk team at AtoB is responsible for managing the credit risk of the customers, transaction and fraud risk, and collections. The Risk Engineering team partners closely with the Risk team and builds systems that help with underwriting of new applications as well as continuous underwriting of existing applications, monitoring transactions, automating KYB checks, detecting fraud and automating manual risk and underwriting processes.

We are looking for a senior engineer with experience in building complex backend systems in the Risk and Fraud domain. You will work with a team of ML and software engineers and also partner with Risk teams including Risk Analysts, Underwriters and Business Operations. You will drive the technical roadmap of the team, work with various engineering leads across product, payments (money), infrastructure and delivery strategic initiatives in a quick, efficiency and reliable manner.

The trucking and logistics industry provides the backbone of the economy. But the payments infrastructure on which it runs is broken. For the hard-working men and women of this sector, the existing suite of payment tools is outdated, difficult to use, prone to fraud, and saddled with shady fee structures. The incumbent players in this space often overlook the economic and practical needs of this user base.

We're changing that. AtoB is building Stripe for Transportation — modernizing the payments infrastructure for trucking and logistics. Supply chains rely on the timely movement of capital to function efficiently. Our end game is a world in which that capital movement occurs fairly, smoothly, and without delay. As we pursue that end game, we aim to center our customers in every way — offering them world-class customer experience and building products that work with and around the unique constraints of their daily lives. We build for fleet managers in the office and drivers on the road. We strive for products that are efficient, satisfying, and useful. Our customers enable our modern economy — they deserve it.

Our history and background

Our founding team has backgrounds working on autonomous vehicles at Cruise Automation, leading ops and growth for Uber, building apps that were featured on the Apple app store, and completing other great projects. We have staff and senior engineers from Google, Uber, Meta, Shopify, etc.

We have raised over $100 million in venture capital from investors such as General Catalyst, Bloomberg Beta, Y Combinator; founders and CEOs of companies like Google (Eric Schmidt), Salesforce (Marc Benioff), Coinbase, DoorDash, Instacart, Mozilla, Wealthfront, Segment, Gusto, Figma; CxOs and founding team members of Uber, PayPal and Stripe; angels like Elad Gil, Naval Ravikant, Gokul Rajaram; and other funds such as Climate Capital, Contrary Capital, Collaborative Fund, Designer Fund, Human Capital, Leadout, XYZ Capital, among others.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.

We are looking for a Senior Full Stack Engineer to join our team. You will help to define our product and engineering roadmaps and work as a part of a cross-functional product team to find elegant solutions to mental healthcare’s many problems. Additionally, you will guide the growth of the engineering team as a senior member.

We are an award-winning, passionate, and mission-driven team with the support of leaders in psychiatry, and backed by prominent VCs including Rethink, RRE, and General Catalyst.

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. If you are a fit, the team will reach out to you about this role or any others that may be a fit for our clients.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.
Our client has raised $4.8M from Sequoia.

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.

We believe all candidates, regardless of who they are, should have a fair chance to work. Established in 2014 and valued at $5B, Checkr is using technology to bring hiring to the next level. Our People Trust Platform uses machine learning to help thousands of companies modernize their background check process and make hiring safer, more efficient, and more inclusive.

Checkr was founded by engineers for engineers; we want to create the best environment for developers to build, learn and love their work.

We are looking for teammates that are highly collaborative, enjoy pairing to solve problems, care deeply about the mission of our company (improving fairness in the criminal justice system), and are eager to work with a diverse team (42% of engineers across the background check program identify as women).

What you bring:
5+ years of software development experience
A preference towards collaboration, TDD, and pair programming
Experience writing performant, reliable, scalable, and secure code
Experience with microservices, queueing architectures, and APIs
Experience spearheading adoption of best practices for the entire team to improve code quality and velocity
Experience providing mentorship to junior engineers
Ruby experience or a desire to learn Ruby

What you get
A fast-paced and collaborative environment
Learning and development allowance
Competitive compensation and opportunity for advancement
100% medical, dental, and vision coverage
Up to 25K reimbursement for fertility, adoption, and parental planning services
Flexible PTO policy

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. If you are a fit, the team will reach out to you about this role or any others that may be a fit for our clients.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.
Our client has raised $4.8M from Sequoia.

Base Salary Range: $150,000 to $200,000

The trucking and logistics industry provides the backbone of the economy. But the payments infrastructure on which it runs is broken. For the hard-working men and women of this sector, the existing suite of payment tools is outdated, difficult to use, prone to fraud, and saddled with shady fee structures. The incumbent players in this space often overlook the economic and practical needs of this user base.

We're changing that. This company is building Stripe for Transportation — modernizing the payments infrastructure for trucking and logistics. Supply chains rely on the timely movement of capital to function efficiently. The end game is a world in which that capital movement occurs fairly, smoothly, and without delay. As this endgame is pursued, the aim is to center customers in every way — offering them world-class customer experience and building products that work with and around the unique constraints of their daily lives. This product is built for fleet managers in the office and drivers on the road. We strive for products that are efficient, satisfying, and useful. Our customers enable our modern economy — they deserve it.

History and background
The founding team have backgrounds working on autonomous vehicles at Cruise Automation, leading ops and growth for Uber, building apps that were featured on the Apple app store, and completing other great projects. We have staff and senior engineers from Google, Uber, Meta, Shopify, Airbnb, etc.

You'll be one of the first 5 employees at a fully-funded and commercially-flourishing startup. Together, we'll reinvent therapy and change the mental health of millions. Details below!

About Us:

Aware Healthcare is turning therapy from an art to a science. We're a venture-backed startup, on a mission to create the highest quality mental health care franchise in the world.

Every day, 100 million Americans struggle with a mental health issue, yet only 10% are receiving care based on science. That's why we're building a new mental health care system driven by data, where patients receive individualized care, clinicians deliver proven treatments, and insurance pays for outcomes not sessions.

While the rest of our industry is optimizing for quantity, we are laser focused on quality. Leveraging our data platform, we recently landed contracts with 6 of the top 7 insurance companies, which unlock access to 111M Americans and pay higher rates than any competitor.

We have raised $5.7mm from top executives at Google, PayPal, Lyft, and AirBnB and investors who previously funded Square, Instacart, Twilio, GrubHub, StitchFix, OpenDoor, and SpaceX. We were founded in 2020 by AJ Goldstein (previously early at Calm and Oura) and are based in San Francisco, CA. You can learn more about Aware here: https://www.awarehc.com/

The Technical Challenge:

We are building the largest digital dataset of an individual's mental health using data from their personal IoT devices (e.g. smartphones, wearables, laptops, smart homes, connected cars).

To do this, we need to build scalable and reliable systems to ingest and process that data, and create innovative user experiences for therapists and patients to get better sooner.

100 million people are currently struggling with a mental health issue in the US alone. This is a problem with a huge scale, and even bigger engineering opportunity.

Integrations: Building new integrations that allow high-quality data to be consistently sourced and aggregated from smartphones, wearables, and more.

At this stage, we're looking for a rockstar. Someone ready to hit the ground running with our existing web applications and build entire new ones from scratch.

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. If you are a fit, the team will reach out to you about this role or any others that may be a fit for our clients.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.
Our client has raised $4.8M from Sequoia.

You'll be one of the first 5 employees at a fully-funded and commercially-flourishing startup. Together, we'll reinvent therapy and change the mental health of millions. Details below!

About Us:

Aware Healthcare is turning therapy from an art to a science. We're a venture-backed startup, on a mission to create the highest quality mental health care franchise in the world.

Every day, 100 million Americans struggle with a mental health issue, yet only 10% are receiving care based on science. That's why we're building a new mental health care system driven by data, where patients receive individualized care, clinicians deliver proven treatments, and insurance pays for outcomes not sessions.

While the rest of our industry is optimizing for quantity, we are laser focused on quality. Leveraging our data platform, we recently landed contracts with 6 of the top 7 insurance companies, which unlock access to 111M Americans and pay higher rates than any competitor.

We have raised $5.7mm from top executives at Google, PayPal, Lyft, and AirBnB and investors who previously funded Square, Instacart, Twilio, GrubHub, StitchFix, OpenDoor, and SpaceX. We were founded in 2020 by AJ Goldstein (previously early at Calm and Oura) and are based in San Francisco CA. You can learn more about Aware here: https://www.awarehc.com/

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. If you are a fit, the team will reach out to you about this role or any others that may be a fit for our clients.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works

Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. If you are a fit, the team will reach out to you about this role or any others that may be a fit for our clients.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective.

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. If you are a fit, the team will reach out to you about this role or any others that may be a fit for our clients.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.
Our client has raised $4.8M from Sequoia.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of our work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
You have deep experience in building modern SPAs: structuring components, managing complex state (Redux/mobx/hook),
modern JS (TypeScript, Flow, or ES8), build systems (webpack/etc).
You're experienced in the presentation layer (modern HTML/CSS) and excited to build pixel-perfect interfaces.
You're comfortable making small back-end changes from time to time to ship features end-to-end.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.

Deliver performant, reliable, scalable, and secure code

What you bring:
5+ years of software development experience working with languages such as Ruby, Python, or GoLang and experience with front-end JavaScript libraries like React.

Experience spearheading adoption of best practices for the entire team to improve code quality and velocity
A strong sense of ownership and responsibility and experience in providing mentorship to junior engineers
Strong collaboration, communication, innovation and project management skills

Brownie points:
Familiarity with interfacing home grown systems with ERP applications
Experience building high throughput, low latency systems
Experience with performing load testing, writing efficient unit tests and integration tests

What you get:
A fast-paced and collaborative environment

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. If you are a fit, the team will reach out to you about this role or any others that may be a fit for our clients.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.

Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required.

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of our work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
You have deep experience in building modern SPAs: structuring components, managing complex state (Redux/mobx/hook),
modern JS (TypeScript, Flow, or ES8), build systems (webpack/etc).
You're experienced in the presentation layer (modern HTML/CSS) and excited to build pixel-perfect interfaces.
You're comfortable making small back-end changes from time to time to ship features end-to-end.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up.

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. If you are a fit, the team will reach out to you about this role or any others that may be a fit for our clients.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of our work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
You have deep experience in building modern SPAs: structuring components, managing complex state (Redux/mobx/hook),
modern JS (TypeScript, Flow, or ES8), build systems (webpack/etc).
You're experienced in the presentation layer (modern HTML/CSS) and excited to build pixel-perfect interfaces.
You're comfortable making small back-end changes from time to time to ship features end-to-end.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.

Deliver performant, reliable, scalable, and secure code

What you bring:
5+ years of software development experience working with languages such as Ruby, Python, or GoLang and experience with front-end JavaScript libraries like React.
Solid understanding of Computer Science fundamentals such as relational databases, data structure and algorithms, Object Relational Mapping etc.
Experience writing performant, reliable, scalable, secure code and experience with microservices, queueing architectures, and APIs etc.
Experience spearheading adoption of best practices for the entire team to improve code quality and velocity
A strong sense of ownership and responsibility and experience in providing mentorship to junior engineers
Strong collaboration, communication, innovation and project management skills

Brownie points:
Familiarity with interfacing home grown systems with ERP applications
Experience building high throughput, low latency systems
Experience with performing load testing, writing efficient unit tests and integration tests

What you get:
A fast-paced and collaborative environment

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.

But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.
Our client has raised $4.8M from Sequoia.

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. If you are a fit, the team will reach out to you about this role or any others that may be a fit for our clients.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.

About Our Client

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. If you are a fit, the team will reach out to you about this role or any others that may be a fit for our clients.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.

We believe all candidates, regardless of who they are, should have a fair chance to work. Established in 2014 and valued at $5B, Checkr is using technology to bring hiring to the next level. Our People Trust Platform uses machine learning to help thousands of companies modernize their background check process and make hiring safer, more efficient, and more inclusive. Some of our customers include Uber, Instacart, Doordash, Netflix, Compass Group, and Adecco.

A career with Checkr is an opportunity to work with some of the best and brightest minds, disrupt an industry for a better future, and give otherwise overlooked candidates access to employment. Checkr has been recognized in Forbes Best Startup Employers and is a top Y Combinator company by valuation.

We are looking for a Staff Backend Software Engineer to join the Background Check Program! The background check program is composed of the Criminal, Motor Vehicle, and Verifications team. Our work involves orchestrating the flow of information from when a customer first places an order for a background check, to interacting with data from thousands of sources, to delivering the final report to customers and candidates. This is the core product and beating heart of Checkr.

Because we process millions of records each year, every engineering challenge our group faces – compliance, data quality, speed, and reliability – is a challenge we face at scale. We also face deep product challenges from a highly fragmented and decentralized data ecosystem, which means every engineering choice we make is also an opportunity to reduce bias in the hiring process.

You will work in a collection of small services built on Ruby and Javascript, with both SQL and NoSQL databases, as well as message queues for asynchronous tasks. Checkr was founded by engineers for engineers; we want to create the best environment for developers to build, learn and love their work.

We are looking for teammates that are highly collaborative, enjoy pairing to solve problems, care deeply about the mission of our company (improving fairness in the criminal justice system), and are eager to work with a diverse team (42% of engineers across the background check program identify as women).

What you bring:
6+ years of software development experience
A preference towards collaboration, TDD, and pair programming
Experience writing performant, reliable, scalable, and secure code
Experience with microservices, queueing architectures, and APIs
Experience spearheading adoption of best practices for the entire team to improve code quality and velocity
Experience providing mentorship to junior engineers

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.

Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use.

We are looking for a Staff Backend Software Engineer to join the Background Check Program! The background check program is composed of the Criminal, Motor Vehicle, and Verifications team. Our work involves orchestrating the flow of information from when a customer first places an order for a background check, to interacting with data from thousands of sources, to delivering the final report to customers and candidates. This is the core product and beating heart of Checkr.

Because we process millions of records each year, every engineering challenge our group faces – compliance, data quality, speed, and reliability – is a challenge we face at scale. We also face deep product challenges from a highly fragmented and decentralized data ecosystem, which means every engineering choice we make is also an opportunity to reduce bias in the hiring process.

Checkr was founded by engineers for engineers; we want to create the best environment for developers to build, learn and love their work.

We are looking for teammates that are highly collaborative, enjoy pairing to solve problems, care deeply about the mission of our company (improving fairness in the criminal justice system), and are eager to work with a diverse team (42% of engineers across the background check program identify as women).

What you bring:
6+ years of software development experience
A preference towards collaboration, TDD, and pair programming
Experience writing performant, reliable, scalable, and secure code
Experience with microservices, queueing architectures, and APIs
Experience spearheading adoption of best practices for the entire team to improve code quality and velocity
Experience providing mentorship to junior engineers
Ruby experience or a desire to learn Ruby

Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use.

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. If you are a fit, the team will reach out to you about this role or any others that may be a fit for our clients.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.
Our client has raised $4.8M from Sequoia.

We believe all candidates, regardless of who they are, should have a fair chance to work. Established in 2014 and valued at $5B, Checkr is using technology to bring hiring to the next level. Our People Trust Platform uses machine learning to help thousands of companies modernize their background check process and make hiring safer, more efficient, and more inclusive.

We are looking for a Staff Backend Software Engineer to join the Background Check Program! The background check program is composed of the Criminal, Motor Vehicle, and Verifications team. Our work involves orchestrating the flow of information from when a customer first places an order for a background check, to interacting with data from thousands of sources, to delivering the final report to customers and candidates. This is the core product and beating heart of Checkr.

Because we process millions of records each year, every engineering challenge our group faces – compliance, data quality, speed, and reliability – is a challenge we face at scale. We also face deep product challenges from a highly fragmented and decentralized data ecosystem, which means every engineering choice we make is also an opportunity to reduce bias in the hiring process.

You will work in a collection of small services built on Ruby and Javascript, with both SQL and NoSQL databases, as well as message queues for asynchronous tasks. Checkr was founded by engineers for engineers; we want to create the best environment for developers to build, learn and love their work.

We are looking for teammates that are highly collaborative, enjoy pairing to solve problems, care deeply about the mission of our company (improving fairness in the criminal justice system), and are eager to work with a diverse team (42% of engineers across the background check program identify as women).

What you bring:
6+ years of software development experience
A preference towards collaboration, TDD, and pair programming
Experience writing performant, reliable, scalable, and secure code
Experience with microservices, queueing architectures, and APIs
Experience spearheading adoption of best practices for the entire team to improve code quality and velocity
Experience providing mentorship to junior engineers
Ruby experience or a desire to learn Ruby

What you get
A fast-paced and collaborative environment
Learning and development allowance
Competitive compensation and opportunity for advancement
100% medical, dental, and vision coverage
Up to 25K reimbursement for fertility, adoption, and parental planning services
Flexible PTO policy

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.

Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality.

We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

We believe all candidates, regardless of who they are, should have a fair chance to work. Established in 2014 and valued at $5B, Checkr is using technology to bring hiring to the next level. Our People Trust Platform uses machine learning to help thousands of companies modernize their background check process and make hiring safer, more efficient, and more inclusive. Some of our customers include Uber, Instacart, Doordash, Netflix, Compass Group, and Adecco.

A career with Checkr is an opportunity to work with some of the best and brightest minds, disrupt an industry for a better future, and give otherwise overlooked candidates access to employment. Checkr has been recognized in Forbes Best Startup Employers and is a top Y Combinator company by valuation.

Checkr is looking for a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer to join Checkr X, our innovation program aimed at finding and bringing to market new product bets for Checkr. This team is specifically thinking about People infrastructure for the future of work, beyond background checks. It’s also designed to operate and iterate quickly like a new startup, while being able to leverage our existing strengths and assets from our core business. Think about joining a startup within a startup!

We are specifically hiring a lead engineer for Checkr Pay - our upcoming bet in the payments space. Checkr Pay is rethinking how workers are paid in the gig economy, by creating a new experience that better serves both gig platforms and their workers alike. Checkr Pay will help gig platforms grow their business while reducing operational burden, and will help gig workers improve their job satisfaction, income potential, and overall financial wellness.

Responsibilities:
Collaborate with our founders and early adopters to design and implement new products
Develop new end to end web applications
Build new industry-leading APIs
Integrate with data sources and vendors in the payments industry

What you bring:
Have founded or held early roles at fast-paced startups
5+ years of full stack software development experience with Ruby (or a similar language) and React
Some good product sense - not every UI flow will have a mockup ready for you :)
A strong sense of ownership from feature design through production release
Understanding of staged rollouts and what’s needed for MVPs - imperfect today is better than perfect next week!
A desire to collaborate with external stakeholders

Brownie Points:
Experience integrating with third-party applications
Experience creating, maintaining, and operating microservices
Experience in securing and optimizing the applications you help create
Experience developing platforms built using an asynchronous event-based architecture
Experience with a variety of payment rails, including ACH, instant push-to-debit, and alternative payment methods (e.g., cash pickup)

What you get:
A fast-paced and collaborative environment
Learning and development allowance
Competitive compensation and opportunity for advancement
100% medical, dental and vision coverage
Up to 25K reimbursement for fertility, adoption, and parental planning services
Flexible PTO policy
Monthly wellness stipend, home office stipend

Checkr has been recognized in Forbes Best Startup Employers and is a top Y Combinator company by valuation.

We are looking for a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer to join the Background Check Program! The background check program is composed of the Criminal, Motor Vehicle, and Verifications teams. Our work involves orchestrating the flow of information from when a customer first places an order for a background check to interacting with data from thousands of sources to delivering the final report to customers and candidates. This is the core product and beating heart of Checkr.

As a member of the Verifications team, your focus will be on a wide product portfolio that includes Drug and Health Screenings, Employment and Education Verifications, and Professional License Verifications to name several in the product space, but also collaborating with the Criminal and Motor Vehicle team on cross-functional initiatives.

Because we process millions of records each year, every engineering challenge our group faces – compliance, data quality, speed, and reliability – is a challenge we face at scale. We also face deep product challenges from a highly fragmented and decentralized data ecosystem, which means every engineering choice we make is also an opportunity to reduce bias in the hiring process.

You will work in a collection of small services built on Ruby and Javascript, with both SQL and NoSQL databases, as well as message queues for asynchronous tasks. Checkr was founded by engineers for engineers; we want to create the best environment for developers to build, learn and love their work.

We are looking for teammates that are highly collaborative, enjoy pairing to solve problems, care deeply about the mission of our company (improving fairness in the criminal justice system), and are eager to work with a diverse team (42% of engineers across the background check program identify as women).

What you bring:
5+ years of software development experience
A preference towards collaboration, TDD, and pair programming
Experience writing performant, reliable, scalable, and secure code
Experience with microservices, queueing architectures, and APIs
Experience spearheading adoption of best practices for the entire team to improve code quality and velocity
Experience providing mentorship to junior engineers
Ruby experience or a desire to learn Ruby

What you get
A fast-paced and collaborative environment
Learning and development allowance
Competitive compensation and opportunity for advancement
100% medical, dental, and vision coverage
Up to 25K reimbursement for fertility, adoption, and parental planning services
Flexible PTO policy
Monthly wellness stipend, home office stipend

The base salary for this position will vary based on geography and other factors. In accordance with Colorado law, the base salary for this role if filled within Colorado is $129,200-$152,000.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams.

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.

As a member of the Verifications team, your focus will be on a wide product portfolio that includes Drug and Health Screenings, Employment and Education Verifications, and Professional License Verifications to name several in the product space, but also collaborating with the Criminal and Motor Vehicle team on cross-functional initiatives.

Because we process millions of records each year, every engineering challenge our group faces – compliance, data quality, speed, and reliability – is a challenge we face at scale.

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. If you are a fit, the team will reach out to you about this role or any others that may be a fit for our clients.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of our work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
You have deep experience in building modern SPAs: structuring components, managing complex state (Redux/mobx/hook),
modern JS (TypeScript, Flow, or ES8), build systems (webpack/etc).
You're experienced in the presentation layer (modern HTML/CSS) and excited to build pixel-perfect interfaces.
You're comfortable making small back-end changes from time to time to ship features end-to-end.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.
Our client has raised $4.8M from Sequoia.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years.

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required.

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. If you are a fit, the team will reach out to you about this role or any others that may be a fit for our clients.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.
Our client has raised $4.8M from Sequoia.

This is the core product and beating heart of Checkr.

Because we process millions of records each year, every engineering challenge our group faces – compliance, data quality, speed, and reliability – is a challenge we face at scale. We also face deep product challenges from a highly fragmented and decentralized data ecosystem, which means every engineering choice we make is also an opportunity to reduce bias in the hiring process.

You will work in a collection of small services built on Ruby and Javascript, with both SQL and NoSQL databases, as well as message queues for asynchronous tasks. Checkr was founded by engineers for engineers; we want to create the best environment for developers to build, learn and love their work.

We are looking for teammates that are highly collaborative, enjoy pairing to solve problems, care deeply about the mission of our company (improving fairness in the criminal justice system), and are eager to work with a diverse team (42% of engineers across the background check program identify as women).

What you bring:
6+ years of software development experience
A preference towards collaboration, TDD, and pair programming
Experience writing performant, reliable, scalable, and secure code
Experience with microservices, queueing architectures, and APIs
Experience spearheading adoption of best practices for the entire team to improve code quality and velocity
Experience providing mentorship to junior engineers
Ruby experience or a desire to learn Ruby

What you get
A fast-paced and collaborative environment
Learning and development allowance
Competitive compensation and opportunity for advancement
100% medical, dental, and vision coverage
Up to 25K reimbursement for fertility, adoption, and parental planning services
Flexible PTO policy
Monthly wellness stipend, home office stipend

The base salary for this position will vary based on geography and other factors. In accordance with Colorado law, the base salary for this role if filled within Colorado is $160,650-$189,000.

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. If you are a fit, the team will reach out to you about this role or any others that may be a fit for our clients.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.
Our client has raised $4.8M from Sequoia.

Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.
Our client has raised $4.8M from Sequoia.

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies.

We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.
Our client has raised $4.8M from Sequoia.

What you bring:
6+ years of software development experience
A preference towards collaboration, TDD, and pair programming
Experience writing performant, reliable, scalable, and secure code
Experience with microservices, queueing architectures, and APIs
Experience spearheading adoption of best practices for the entire team to improve code quality and velocity
Experience providing mentorship to junior engineers
Ruby experience or a desire to learn Ruby

What you get
A fast-paced and collaborative environment
Learning and development allowance
Competitive compensation and opportunity for advancement

We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.

We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. If you are a fit, the team will reach out to you about this role or any others that may be a fit for our clients.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.
Our client has raised $4.8M from Sequoia.

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. If you are a fit, the team will reach out to you about this role or any others that may be a fit for our clients.

About Our Client

The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust.

The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart.

Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture.

What They're Building

Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed.

Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative

About You
You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of their work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our client's users.
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined.
How Our Client Works
Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation.
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners.
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux.
Our client has raised $4.8M from Sequoia.

Checkr has been recognized in Forbes Best Startup Employers and is a top Y Combinator company by valuation.

We are looking for a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer to join the Background Check Program! The background check program is composed of the Criminal, Motor Vehicle, and Verifications teams. Our work involves orchestrating the flow of information from when a customer first places an order for a background check to interacting with data from thousands of sources to delivering the final report to customers and candidates. This is the core product and beating heart of Checkr.

As a member of the Verifications team, your focus will be on a wide product portfolio that includes Drug and Health Screenings, Employment and Education Verifications, and Professional License Verifications to name several in the product space, but also collaborating with the Criminal and Motor Vehicle team on cross-functional initiatives.

Because we process millions of records each year, every engineering challenge our group faces – compliance, data quality, speed, and reliability – is a challenge we face at scale. We also face deep product challenges from a highly fragmented and decentralized data ecosystem, which means every engineering choice we make is also an opportunity to reduce bias in the hiring process.

You will work in a collection of small services built on Ruby and Javascript, with both SQL and NoSQL databases, as well as message queues for asynchronous tasks. Checkr was founded by engineers for engineers; we want to create the best environment for developers to build, learn and love their work.

We are looking for teammates that are highly collaborative, enjoy pairing to solve problems, care deeply about the mission of our company (improving fairness in the criminal justice system), and are eager to work with a diverse team (42% of engineers across the background check program identify as women).

What you bring:
5+ years of software development experience
A preference towards collaboration, TDD, and pair programming
Experience writing performant, reliable, scalable, and secure code
Experience with microservices, queueing architectures, and APIs
Experience spearheading adoption of best practices for the entire team to improve code quality and velocity
Experience providing mentorship to junior engineers
Ruby experience or a desire to learn Ruby

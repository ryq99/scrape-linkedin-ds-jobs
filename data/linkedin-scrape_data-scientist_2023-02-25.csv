About The Role

Managers of Data Science lead their teams to higher levels of productivity. They collaborate with their team to find what works and what changes should be made to optimize for the long term.
Managers of Data Science actively participate in all aspects of product strategy. For data-driven products, managers have end-to-end ownership including designing, building, and delivering customer-facing products.

You have the necessary skills to roll up your sleeves and jump into data with your fellow data scientists. You can lead by example and bring your team to a solution.
Managers of Data Science contribute to more than our product–they build up a team built on a foundation of generosity and openness. We expect our Data Scientists to help make others better and raise the bar for those around them.
You will lead a highly productive team and continuously optimize for the long term in collaboration with your team.
You will support the career growth of your team using your excellent listening skills, effective feedback, and the technical expertise that allows you to match contributors to projects that best develop their skills.

You have an abundance of curiosity and take a proactive approach to learning and developing new skills.

You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what delights our clients and to move one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.

You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to support your fellow teammates.
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

What You Bring To The Table

You are intellectually curious and enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.
You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.
You communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.
Preferred, a BS/MS with 12 years or a PhD with 8+ years of experience working in a data-driven role. Your demonstrated experience leading productive, impactful data science teams and projects is more important than your level of education.
You make effective use of big data technologies such as Spark and AWS, write efficient SQL, and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. We do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. We care that you learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.

Are you eager to join a dynamic, globally-connected team where your contributions will make a meaningful difference in building a better media ecosystem? Come and see why Fortune magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among the best small-medium-sized workplaces globally.

Our Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in most aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.
Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges.
You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages; graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data; and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.
Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. We are a team built on a foundation of generosity and openness, and we expect our Data Scientists to help make others better and raise the bar for those around them.

Who We Are Looking For

You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.
You make your team better through training and mentoring those around you. You are a guardian of and advocate for quality within your team.
You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You are a broadly skilled data scientist who may have experience working with embedded models in always-on production systems and may have worked across a variety of technologies and data sources.
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest

and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.

You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

What You Bring To The Table

You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.
You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.
You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.
Preferred, a BS/MS with 10+ years or a PhD with 5+ years of experience working in a data-driven role. What is most important to us is what and how you can contribute though which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.
You make effective use of big data technologies such as Spark and AWS, are able to write efficient SQL, and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.

About The Role

Our Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will have the opportunity to participate in most aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.
Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges.
You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages; graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data; and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.
Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. We are a team built on a foundation of generosity and openness, and we expect our Data Scientists to help make others better and raise the bar for those around them.

Who We Are Looking For

You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed contributions to components of large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.
You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You are a broadly skilled data scientist who may have experience working with embedded models in always-on production systems and may have worked across a variety of technologies and data sources.
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible

ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.

You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

What You Bring To The Table

You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.
You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.
You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.
Preferred, a BS/MS with 5 to 10 years or a PhD with 2 to 5 years of experience working in a data-driven role. What is most important to us is what and how you can contribute though which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.
You make effective use of big data technologies such as Spark and AWS, are able to write efficient SQL, and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.

About The Role

Managers of Data Science lead their teams to higher levels of productivity. They collaborate with their team to find what works and what changes should be made to optimize for the long term.
Managers of Data Science actively participate in all aspects of product strategy. For data-driven products, managers have end-to-end ownership including designing, building, and delivering customer-facing products.
Depending on your interests and background, you will tackle problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages; graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data; and causal inference with missing data.
You have the necessary skills to roll up your sleeves and jump into data with your fellow data scientists. You can lead by example and bring your team to a solution.
Managers of Data Science contribute to more than our product–they build up a team built on a foundation of generosity and openness. We expect our Data Scientists to help make others better and raise the bar for those around them.
You will lead a highly productive team and continuously optimize for the long term in collaboration with your team.
You will support the career growth of your team using your excellent listening skills, effective feedback, and the technical expertise that allows you to match contributors to projects that best develop their skills.

Who We Are Looking For

You have a sustained track record of leading data scientists while making significant strategic and tactical contributions to large, impactful software projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' and convey that vision to your team.
You have an abundance of curiosity and take a proactive approach to learning and developing new skills.
You have strong data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what delights our clients and to move one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to support your fellow teammates.
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

What You Bring To The Table

You are intellectually curious and enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.
You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.
You communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.
Preferred, a BS/MS with 12 years or a PhD with 8+ years of experience working in a data-driven role. Your demonstrated experience leading productive, impactful data science teams and projects is more important than your level of education.
You make effective use of big data technologies such as Spark and AWS, write efficient SQL, and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. We do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. We care that you learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.

Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

To solve this problem, we expanded into software and built integrated solutions to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

Job Description

As a Machine Learning Engineer within the Risk Machine Learning and Decision Science team, you work on projects that enable a software driven, machine learning centric view on all money movement and every transaction within the rapidly growing Square ecosystem. This touches on actively maximizing the trade off of revenue growth and risk using artificial intelligence. The machine learning driven software that we release interacts with every transaction and money movement within our seller ecosystem - a profound degree of scale and impact. Such machine learning techniques touch on reinforcement learning, decision theory, deep learning sequence modeling, natural language processing, and optimization theory. In addition, we also strive to provide our sellers, through seller facing products, with transparency around why our machine learning made a particular decision. This touches on algorithms in the relatively new space of explainable artificial intelligence.

Our algorithms derive value from our unique and rich data from our entire product portfolio within our rapidly growing seller ecosystem. We partner with business, product, operations, and engineering teams to drive optimal decision making systems using sophisticated modeling and machine learning. We’re a passionate team of entrepreneurs, scientists, and engineers who are shipping machine learning software that actively actively manages Square’s view on each transaction as it pertains to our revenue growth and risk.

You will:
Build machine learning/deep learning models that analyze payment activity in real time across our Seller’s ecosystem consisting of payments, banking, and debit card products.
Adapt existing machine learning methods and transfer learning to develop solutions that work at global scale
Leverage an experimentation mindset along with state-of-the-art algorithms to create preventative systems, collaborate on new product features to drive losses down, and explore new datasets (including 3rd party data) to engineer new features for our models.
Collaborate with business leaders, subject matter experts, and decision makers to develop success criteria and optimize new products, features, policies, and models
Research, design, develop, and test a range of classification, regression and optimization problems

Qualifications

You have:
An advanced degree (M.S., PhD.), preferably in Computer Science,Engineering, Statistics, Physics, Mathematics or a related technical field
PhD plus 3 years (or Master plus 5 years) industry working experience in applied Machine learning or Deep learning
A strong track record of performing machine learning model development using Python (numpy, pandas, tensorflow, pytorch, scikit-learn, etc.) and SQL/NoSQL interaction patterns
Expert level knowledge of modern techniques in machine learning and deep learning, e.g., tree models, transformer network architectures, with an orientation to maximizing such algorithms in a large scale production setting.
Familiarity with Linux/OS X command line, version control software (git), and general software development principles with a machine learning software development life-cycle orientation
Machine learning strategic sequencing of methodological and software improvements to work back from maximizing core metrics associated with optimizing the business
The ability to clearly communicate complex results to technical and non-technical audiences and stakeholders (PMs, Operations, Engineers)

Are you eager to join a dynamic, globally-connected team where your contributions will make a meaningful difference in building a better media ecosystem? Come and see why Fortune magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among the best small-medium-sized workplaces globally.

About The Role

Our Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients. As a Lead Staff Data Scientist, you will contribute meaningfully through leading others as well as serve as the people manager for a small team of direct reports.
Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges.
You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages; graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data; and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.
Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. We are a team built on a foundation of generosity and openness, and we expect our Data Scientists to help make others better and raise the bar for those around them.

Who We Are Looking For

You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to complex, multi-layered, impactful data-focused projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing and anticipate problems that may be several degrees removed from obvious requirements.
You make your team better by proactively advocating for and driving improvements not just to what the team produces, but also the ways in which the team works.
You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You are a broadly skilled data scientist with deep expertise working with embedded models in always-on production systems and working across a variety of technologies and data sources.
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

What You Bring To The Table

You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.
You have experience as a people manager. You may have successfully helped guide the career growth of your reports or participated in the hiring process.
You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.
You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.
Preferred, a BS/MS with 12 years or a PhD with 8+ years of experience working in a data-driven role. What is most important to us is what and how you can contribute though which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.
You make effective use of big data technologies such as Spark and AWS, are able to write efficient SQL, and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

The Jr Developer Program is a unique employment opportunity for students seeking to gain on-the-job business intelligence engineering experience and receive excellent mentoring while completing their education. Jr Developers are immersed in an Amazon team and work on exciting, meaningful projects that impact real Amazon customers. Paired 1:1 with a Amazon Jr Dev Mentor, Jr Developers receive guidance and support in all aspects of their role: skill development, career advisement, project collaboration, and more! Upon successful completion of the Jr Developer Program, the opportunity for full-time employment will be available at the Amazon corporate sites in Seattle, WA.

Our Internship Program Is Unique In Several Respects
We offer work year-round, part-time (16 hrs/week) while in school and full-time (40hrs/week) during summer. Working schedules are flexible and can be re-arranged each quarter to accommodate class schedules.
We offer excellent mentoring. Our full-time data scientists and business intelligence engineers are willing and able to mentor exceptional student BIEs.
Jr BIEs are given responsibilities and roles that prepare them to enter the workforce after graduation with “real world” BIE and data science experience.
The students who participate in the Jr Developer Program routinely say that the real reason they’re here is for the valuable learning experience, especially because of the uniform excellence of the team they work with, the mentoring offered by experienced data scientists and BIEs, and the challenge of being a principal contributor to software products. They say it’s like taking an additional practicum course that complements their university experience.

Key job responsibilities

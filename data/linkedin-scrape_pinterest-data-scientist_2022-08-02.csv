Warp,Software Engineer,"New York, NY","Software Engineer, Warp, New York, NY, Hide job, 3 days ago","About Warp: The cloud-backed terminal for individuals and teams

Warp is modernizing the command line experience to make it more intuitive and collaborative for modern developers and teams, turning the terminal into a real platform to enable engineering workflows. Our mission is to elevate developer productivity, and the team is excited to have this opportunity to radically improve a tool that every developer uses and fundamentally change how software development and devops are done.

We are a company run by product-first builders, building a core product for all developers. We are committed to understanding our users deeply. We believe we will ultimately build the best product and business if that team includes developers and designers from a wide range of backgrounds. The early team comes from Google, Dropbox, Gem, LinkedIn, and Facebook. We are looking for passionate individuals to join us and help bring Warp to the world.

We value honesty, humility, and pragmatism, and our core product principle is focusing on the user. If you're interested in learning more about our company values and what our engineering team culture is like, please take a look at our internal How We Work guide.

We're very fortunate to be backed by a great group of venture capital firms. As of October 2021, we closed a $23M Series A, led by Dylan Field (Co-Founder and CEO, Figma). Other investors include Google Ventures, Neo, and Box Group, as well as a network of passionate angels, including Elad Gil (early investor in Airbnb, Pinterest, Stripe, and Square), Jeff Weiner (Executive Chairman and Ex-CEO, LinkedIn), and Marc Benioff (Founder and CEO, Salesforce).

The Product

Here's a quick demo showing some of our current features…

This is just the start, as our plan is to build out a set of experiences in the terminal that don't exist today like collaboration, environment sharing, rich data types and more.

The Opportunity

The terminal is one of very few tools used by every developer every day, which makes it an ideal gateway to improving all sorts of developer activities. We believe there is an opportunity to build a unicorn-sized business improving the command-line. Our strategy is bottom-up developer adoption, followed by driving revenue through enterprise sales and distribution partnerships.

To start, our goal is to become the everyday terminal of choice with individual users – immediately usable as a backwards-compatible terminal replacement with the developer's shell of choice. We have built a closed-source server, which will implement all of the cloud-enabled features. These features will invite users to share their work with others, driving growth and encouraging collaboration. We'll also focus on building a community and an ecosystem of terminal plugins and apps, creating network effects.

At higher levels of team penetration, we will offer an enterprise plan with features around privacy, security and environment management (e.g. secure distribution and management of API keys). These larger enterprise plans will be the ultimate driver of revenue, along with potential distribution deals for companies that see CLI integrations as a way to reach new customers.

A couple college students, totally unprompted, wrote a piece on why new students should work at Warp as part of their new newsletter they are launching called ""Why You Should Join."" It's an incredibly well researched and thoughtful article about the market and competitive landscape, and accurately reflects our thesis. Read it here.

Why this role?

We are looking for outstanding software engineers who want to work on re-imagining a product that we developers use every day.

As a Software Engineer, you will…
Have the chance to tackle difficult technical problems. One of the main reasons there has been little innovation in this space is that, for historical reasons, the terminal/shell division makes it hard to innovate.
Work on a fast moving project right from day one
Be a foundational member of our early team and shape company culture and long-term engineering practices

You may be a good fit if...
You are passionate about helping developers get more done — would jump at the chance to work on this particular product
You have amazing engineering chops, but are also product- and user-focused
You have great communication and collaboration skills
You're sensitive to developers' needs, and can develop warm relationships with developers
Bonus:
Building native apps in Rust or WASM
Shell or Linux-programming
OpenGL, WebG, or other graphics programming
Building open-source software
At Warp, we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace. So if you're excited about this role, but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every qualification in this job description – we encourage you to apply anyways! We are a community of curious learners, and most of us are learning some skills for the first time (like our engineers learning to program Warp in Rust). You might be just the right candidate for this or other roles.

Warp,Growth Engineer,"New York, NY","Growth Engineer, Warp, New York, NY, Medical, Vision, Dental, 401(k), Hide job, Your profile matches this job, 3 days ago, 5 applicants","About Warp: The cloud-backed terminal for individuals and teams

Warp is modernizing the command line experience to make it more intuitive and collaborative for modern developers and teams, turning the terminal into a real platform to enable engineering workflows. Our mission is to elevate developer productivity, and the team is excited to have this opportunity to radically improve a tool that every developer uses and fundamentally change how software development and devops are done.

We are a company run by product-first builders, building a core product for all developers. We are committed to understanding our users deeply. We believe we will ultimately build the best product and business if that team includes developers and designers from a wide range of backgrounds. The early team comes from Google, Dropbox, Gem, LinkedIn, and Facebook. We are looking for passionate individuals to join us and help bring Warp to the world.

We value honesty, humility, and pragmatism, and our core product principle is focusing on the user. If you're interested in learning more about our company values and what our engineering team culture is like, please take a look at our internal How We Work guide.

We're very fortunate to be backed by a great group of venture capital firms. As of October 2021, we closed a $23M Series A, led by Dylan Field (Co-Founder and CEO, Figma). Other investors include Google Ventures, Neo, and Box Group, as well as a network of passionate angels, including Elad Gil (early investor in Airbnb, Pinterest, Stripe, and Square), Jeff Weiner (Executive Chairman and Ex-CEO, LinkedIn), and Marc Benioff (Founder and CEO, Salesforce).

The Product

Here's a quick demo showing some of our current features…

This is just the start, as our plan is to build out a set of experiences in the terminal that don't exist today like collaboration, environment sharing, rich data types and more.

The Opportunity

The terminal is one of very few tools used by every developer every day, which makes it an ideal gateway to improving all sorts of developer activities. We believe there is an opportunity to build a unicorn-sized business improving the command-line. Our strategy is bottom-up developer adoption, followed by driving revenue through enterprise sales and distribution partnerships.

To start, our goal is to become the everyday terminal of choice with individual users – immediately usable as a backwards-compatible terminal replacement with the developer's shell of choice. We have built a closed-source server, which will implement all of the cloud-enabled features. These features will invite users to share their work with others, driving growth and encouraging collaboration. We'll also focus on building a community and an ecosystem of terminal plugins and apps, creating network effects.

At higher levels of team penetration, we will offer an enterprise plan with features around privacy, security and environment management (e.g. secure distribution and management of API keys). These larger enterprise plans will be the ultimate driver of revenue, along with potential distribution deals for companies that see CLI integrations as a way to reach new customers.

A couple college students, totally unprompted, wrote a piece on why new students should work at Warp as part of their new newsletter they are launching called ""Why You Should Join."" It's an incredibly well researched and thoughtful article about the market and competitive landscape, and accurately reflects our thesis. Read it here.

Why this role?

We're hiring a Growth Engineer to propel user growth through product-led-growth. You'll get to work on a fast moving project right from day one, and help lay the foundation for early monetization and sales. This is an opportunity to work on arguably the most important developer tool ever: the terminal. You will spread Warp to all developers from all backgrounds, and all software companies.

As a Growth Engineer, your job will be to help drive product-led growth. You will work with the Growth Lead to prioritize features that drive retention and engagement, and shape Warp towards becoming a viable team product. You will also build innovative projects that drive acquisition and enable the team to make data-driven decisions. You'll impact the whole user funnel from top to bottom: from acquisition, activation, retention, and engagement.

This is a hybrid role. You will spend roughly 50% of your time on growth/product, and roughly 50% of your time on engineering.

As a Growth Engineer, these are the areas you'll get to drive…
Retention & Engagement
Figure out how to increase week 1 retention
Measure the drop-offs in our onboarding funnel and list reasons for the drop-off
Propose our best-fit user persona through segmentation
Rank a list of game-changing features that will increase our product-market fit
Work with Support Engineers to create a product process for prioritizing the most important bugs reported each week
You will help shape the product roadmap, and ensure that our engineering team is building features that meaningfully lift up our user retention and engagement rates. You will conduct user research, conduct data analysis, and process written user feedback, to prioritize features.
Examples of projects you might take on:
Team Product
Figure out what the best-fit team and company is for the product
Design and implement a design partner program such that we get regular feedback during the product development process
Rank a list of pain points that teams face in collaborating with commands and the terminal
Conduct willingness-to-pay studies to figure out initial pricing plans
Instrument metrics that monitor the team product usage and revenue
You will help make Warp a viable team product that users use and teams want to pay for. You will interface with partner teams to help us iterate on the product. When the time comes, you will also help to figure out early monetization.
Examples of responsibilities include:
Growth Engineering
A feature that allows users to publish a link that replays terminal sessions in Warp
A web version of our Open AI command-search feature
Integrations into IDEs and other external tools
Marketing site revamps and experiments
Building an experimentation platform
Standing up and maintaining our data stack: a data warehouse, an ETL tool, and a BI tool
You will work with the Developer Advocates on boosting acquisition and building viral loops around the Warp app:
You will also help to manage the data pipeline. We currently use Segment and Amplitude. In the future, you might also take on infrastructure projects such as:
For the right candidate, additional responsibilities may include:
Building growth-related features in the Warp app, such as onboarding, referrals, team product, and telemetry
You may be a good fit if...
You're an experienced engineer familiar with Javascript on the front end
You're comfortable with building and maintaining dashboards using an analytics tool
You have experience working with data platforms like Segment, analytics tools like Amplitude and Looker, ETL like Stitch or Fivetran, data warehouses like Snowflake or BigQuery
You're excited to speak with users and advocate for their needs
You're able to collaborate cross-functionally with product and engineering
You're a strong written and verbal communicator
Bonus:
Experience with A/B tests and/or growth modeling
Prior experience in growth or developer tools
Strong eye for design
At Warp, we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace. So if you're excited about this role, but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every qualification in this job description – we encourage you to apply anyways! We are a community of curious learners, and most of us are learning some skills for the first time (like our engineers learning to program Warp in Rust).

Job Title: Software Engineer
Reports to: Engineering Manager
Location:

FranklinCovey Summary
Franklin Covey Co. (NYSE: FC) is one of the world's largest leadership companies with 1,000 employees, 1,500 clients and 2,000,000+ learners. We help organizations achieve greatness on the four people-related challenges that matter most: leadership, individual effectiveness, culture and business processes. Our unique approach combines content, technology and people to generate collective behavior change at scale. Our core product, the FranklinCovey All Access Pass®, provides companies access to 20+ courses in multiple modalities and in >20 languages. The All Access Pass has grown from $0 to $100MM in recurring revenue in the last five years, making it among the fastest growing products in edtech.

Role Context
Historically FC primarily offered in-person, one-off training. Over the last five years we have made substantial investments, and have had significant success, transitioning the business to an online, subscription product (AAP). In April ‘21 FC acquired Strive, an edtech startup whose leadership development platform was used by leading tech cos like Slack, Airbnb, Pinterest and Intuit. Under the Strive's team direction and leadership, we are doubling down on the technology/product-centric approach and looking to build out a larger product and engineering team.

Role Summary
As a Software Engineer, you will build products to help organizations train their employees and overcome their most pressing people-related problems at scale. You will work with product, design, data, and content teams to build a modern learning platform, scaling usage (and impact) 10-100x in the next year.

Essential Job Functions
Ideate: Engineers participate early in the product development process. You will review regular quantitative and qualitative research about our clients and learners and weigh in on the product strategy and roadmap.
Collaborate: You will partner with product, data and design to define the product features and functionality to ensure we're building the right thing at the right time and in the right way.
Build: You will ship regularly and iteratively, writing testable, readable and maintainable code.
Support: You will work with the sales, marketing, implementation and support teams to ensure users get the most value from the products you've built.

Job Requirements
2-5 years of experience building and shipping high-quality products (years of experience ≠ ability, so we'll use this as a proxy but not a hard requirement).
Back-end experience with Node.js, Python (Django), or Ruby on Rails and front-end experience with React preferred but not required. We're looking for great engineers and are confident that you can learn the tech stack with time and direction.
Drive to continually improve and share knowledge with your teammates.
Experience with performance, security, privacy, accessibility, and localization/globalization preferred but not required.
Experience architecting or refactoring systems of moderate complexity preferred but not required.

Why We Think This is a Great Opportunity
Interesting Product, Technical and Organizational Challenges – This year we will increase the number of users on Strive's learning platform 100 to 1000x. This will require us to solve a number of interesting product, technical and organizational challenges – whatever your unique interest is, there's likely a good challenge for you to work on.
Impact at Scale – FranklinCovey positively impacts the lives of millions of learners and tens of millions of their direct reports every year – FC directly teaches 4x as many learners in the US as all US business schools combined! By building out platform integrations for learning and planning in the flow of work, you'll substantially increase the quality of the learning experience and thus improve the skills and experiences of that enormous audience.
Startup Speed, Established Company Security – FranklinCovey's product & tech org is small relative to the company's learner/client scale, so you'll be able to move quickly to build a strategy and ship great products. Unlike a startup, FC is an established (and profitable!) publicly traded company, so you won't worry about the next funding round falling through and a lack of job security.

Company Information
Franklin Covey Co. (NYSE: FC) is a global, public company, specializing in organizational performance improvement. We help organizations achieve results that require lasting changes in human behavior. Our world-class solutions enable greatness in individuals, teams and organizations and are accessible through the FranklinCovey All Access Pass® available in multiple modalities and in 21 languages.

Warp,Data Engineer,"New York, NY","Data Engineer, Warp, New York, NY, Medical, Vision, Dental, 401(k), Hide job, 3 days ago, 13 applicants","About Warp: The cloud-backed terminal for individuals and teams

Warp is modernizing the command line experience to make it more intuitive and collaborative for modern developers and teams, turning the terminal into a real platform to enable engineering workflows. Our mission is to elevate developer productivity, and the team is excited to have this opportunity to radically improve a tool that every developer uses and fundamentally change how software development and devops are done.

We are a company run by product-first builders, building a core product for all developers. We are committed to understanding our users deeply. We believe we will ultimately build the best product and business if that team includes developers and designers from a wide range of backgrounds. The early team comes from Google, Dropbox, Gem, LinkedIn, and Facebook. We are looking for passionate individuals to join us and help bring Warp to the world.

We value honesty, humility, and pragmatism, and our core product principle is focusing on the user. If you're interested in learning more about our company values and what our engineering team culture is like, please take a look at our internal How We Work guide.

We're very fortunate to be backed by a great group of venture capital firms. As of October 2021, we closed a $23M Series A, led by Dylan Field (Co-Founder and CEO, Figma). Other investors include Google Ventures, Neo, and Box Group, as well as a network of passionate angels, including Elad Gil (early investor in Airbnb, Pinterest, Stripe, and Square), Jeff Weiner (Executive Chairman and Ex-CEO, LinkedIn), and Marc Benioff (Founder and CEO, Salesforce).

The Product

Here's a quick demo showing some of our current features…

This is just the start, as our plan is to build out a set of experiences in the terminal that don't exist today like collaboration, environment sharing, rich data types and more.

The Opportunity

The terminal is one of very few tools used by every developer every day, which makes it an ideal gateway to improving all sorts of developer activities. We believe there is an opportunity to build a unicorn-sized business improving the command-line. Our strategy is bottom-up developer adoption, followed by driving revenue through enterprise sales and distribution partnerships.

To start, our goal is to become the everyday terminal of choice with individual users – immediately usable as a backwards-compatible terminal replacement with the developer's shell of choice. We have built a closed-source server, which will implement all of the cloud-enabled features. These features will invite users to share their work with others, driving growth and encouraging collaboration. We'll also focus on building a community and an ecosystem of terminal plugins and apps, creating network effects.

At higher levels of team penetration, we will offer an enterprise plan with features around privacy, security and environment management (e.g. secure distribution and management of API keys). These larger enterprise plans will be the ultimate driver of revenue, along with potential distribution deals for companies that see CLI integrations as a way to reach new customers.

A couple college students, totally unprompted, wrote a piece on why new students should work at Warp as part of their new newsletter they are launching called ""Why You Should Join."" It's an incredibly well researched and thoughtful article about the market and competitive landscape, and accurately reflects our thesis. Read it here.

Why this role?

We're hiring a Data Engineer to build our data infrastructure from the ground up, and help enable Warp to make data-driven decisions. You'll get to work on a fast moving project right from day one, and power the data behind every function at Warp, touching everything from: product, engineering, and marketing. Your goal is to set Warp up so every teammate can make better decisions based on data.

As our first Data hire, you'll be able to stand up data infrastructure from zero to one. You'll be foundational in establishing the company's culture around data. On top of working with engineers, you will also get to work closely with business functions like product and marketing, and sharpen your business acumen.

As a Data Engineer, these are the areas you'll get to drive…
Data Analysis
Segmenting customers based on behavior, channel, and company size
Finding factors that contribute to engagement and churn
Analyzing funnels in onboarding and activation
Warp is in the early phase of leveraging data to prioritize product work. We have dashboards that tell us the basics about usage, retention, and acquisition. With a much larger user base now, the number of insights we can draw has expanded. As the product becomes more complex, the need for insights has also grown.
We need someone to mine and translate these insights to better the product. You will be key in identifying and monitoring data insights that help to inform the product roadmap.
Some responsibilities include:
Data infrastructure and product
Build an experimentation platform and work with Product to execute growth experiments
Stand up our data stack: a data warehouse, an ETL tool, and a BI tool
Build infrastructure to ensure data is secured and conforms to compliance requirements
Warp's data stack is currently Segment, Amplitude, and Google Analytics. But as Warp approaches the next phase of growth, we can take advantage of the larger data set to drive product and marketing.
We need someone to build the next version of our data stack from the ground up.
Some strategic infrastructure projects might include:
In the future, there will also be opportunities to build data-centric features in the product, for example providing the user with CLI analytics, or making command suggestions more intelligent.
Growth
Building a system for monitoring product-qualified leads and surfacing them for Partnerships and Sales
Drive marketing decisions: measuring the effectiveness of channels, running A/B tests on copy on marketing and login pages, etc.
This is a role that spans all functions at Warp. You will get to leverage your business instincts to power Warp's growth.
Some responsibilities include:
You may be a good fit if...
You're experienced in engineering or data engineering
You have deep knowledge of SQL
You have experience working with data platforms like Segment, analytics tools like Amplitude and Looker, ETL like Stitch or Fivetran, data warehouses like Snowflake or BigQuery, and data pipeline tools like Kafka and Airflow
You're comfortable with building data products and infrastructure from 0 to 1
You have strong communication skills, and are able to explain complex data topics to a non-technical audience in simple ways
You're able to collaborate cross-functionally with product and engineering
You're comfortable with working through different stages of a company's growth and the corresponding data stacks
Bonus:
Worked on a product-led growth company or developer tools company before
Experience working with Marketing and Sales platforms like Salesforce and Customer.io
Familiar with GCP
At Warp, we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace. So if you're excited about this role, but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every qualification in this job description – we encourage you to apply anyways! We are a community of curious learners, and most of us are learning some skills for the first time (like our engineers learning to program Warp in Rust). You might be just the right candidate for this or other roles.

What We Offer
Competitive Salary & Equity – we will stretch to get the right talent on board
Full Medical, Dental and Vision Benefits
Flexible remote-first culture, with WeWork options in SF and an optional office space in NYC for folks who want to work together IRL
20-days of Paid Time Off
12 US Holidays
Twice-a-year company retreats
Monthly gym stipend
401(k)

Scratch's mission is to reinvent the way that people experience their debt. Users can only understand their financial statuses fully when they can trust that their financial information is safe with us. Therefore, security is built into everything we do: product design, feature development, architecture, operations, and customer support. Our goal in security engineering is to provide delightful platform and product security. We strive to go above and beyond in protecting user data, implementing layered defenses, and making enforcement and compliance easy.

We're looking for engineers to work on all aspects of product security. Security work at Scratch is not just a matter of checking for common vulnerabilities or enforcing compliance with a checklist of best practices. We think through problems from first principles, and work with the whole company to design and deliver trustworthy systems that serve users and operators correctly in the face of hostile action. This means working at all levels of system building: product design, infrastructure, user experience, phishing and fraud prevention, attack vector analysis, and everything in between.

Research emerging threats and evolving best practices, and educate the rest of the team about your findings.
Work with our advisors and third party vendors on pen tests, security reports and compliance projects.

You have in-depth knowledge of security issues at many levels of the modern computing stack.
You have a well-developed mental toolkit for thinking adversarially and holistically about systems.
You excel at communicating analyses of technical issues and recommendations for addressing them.
You can make systems as well as break them; you're as comfortable building software as you are finding holes in it.
You're passionate about protecting both users and customers.

Scratch,Software Engineer - Fullstack,"San Francisco, CA","Software Engineer - Fullstack, Scratch, San Francisco, CA, Medical, Vision, Dental, +1 benefit, Hide job, 5 months ago","About Scratch

Scratch's mission is to build a repayment platform to change the way consumers experience debt. Most of us take on debt to help us get ahead, or in many cases, to not fall behind. But for most of us—despite its necessity—once we have debt, it doesn't play a healthy role in our lives. It can be hard to understand, difficult to manage, and unaccommodating to changes in our lives.

This is why we started Scratch. We wanted to reinvent the loan servicing industry, well—from scratch. We wanted to create a world where debt plays a healthier and less taxing role in more people's lives. By bringing world-class product and technical thinking to a multi-trillion industry that hasn't seen innovation in well over two decades, Scratch's platform empowers borrowers to have greater control, visibility and flexibility over their financial health, removing the traditional loan servicer from the equation altogether and bringing borrowers closer to their lenders.

Our team is rapidly growing and comes from diverse backgrounds including Dropbox, Pinterest, Prosper, Bloomberg and Ripple. Our office is based in San Francisco.

With a rapidly growing community of lenders and borrowers, we think it's time the world knows there's a better way to pay back their loans. We'd love for you to join in our mission and help play a role in changing the way we experience debt for the better!

Scratch’s backend and frontend presents many interesting challenges and opportunities for designing and architecting complex systems. Our APIs and user experience caters to both many personas: Enterprise (Lenders, Creditors), Consumers (Borrowers, Internal Operations). You and your team will work on high-stakes engineering challenges that will shape the future of loan servicing and debt. What's at stake? Scratch aims to be the source of truth for trillions of dollars. It's crucial that our novel platform ensures accuracy and precision on non-trivial math down to seven decimal places with zero data loss or security compromises, resiliency to handle a large number of loans at scale as well as the flexibility to handle new and innovative financial instruments.

About the role:
Design core pieces of Scratch’s APIs and user experiences, optimizing for long-term maintainability, performance, and reliability.
You will work across multiple personas: lenders, creditors, borrowers and internal users.
Take full ownership and responsibility for building, shipping, and maintaining core Scratch APIs, end-to-end.

You may be a good fit if:
2+ years industry experience.
You enjoy being a generalist working on both the frontend, backend, and anything it takes to solve problems and delight users both internally and externally.
You have a strong background in computer science.

We want you!

If you made it this far, chances are you’re as excited about working to change how people experience debt as we are—and we love that. Please apply even if you’re unsure about whether you meet every single requirement in this posting. Scratch is looking for smart, intellectually curious people who are invested in our mission, not just those who can “check all the boxes”.

Benefits we Provide:

Health insurance: We cover 99% of your healthcare premiums and 70% of your dependent’s premiums and offer competitive medical, dental, and vision insurance plans.

Learning and development stipend: We offer a $1,500 per year stipend for your personal career development!

Wellness benefit: We’re proud to provide employees a $100/month pre-tax credit towards any gym or fitness program.

Catered lunches and snacks: We have high-quality catered lunches every day and well-stocked kitchens.

Generous PTO (including your birthday!), sick leave, and parental leave

401k program: We offer a 401k program!

Scratch's mission is to build a repayment platform to change the way consumers experience debt. Most of us take on debt to help us get ahead, or in many cases, to not fall behind. But for most of us—despite its necessity—once we have debt, it doesn't play a healthy role in our lives. It can be hard to understand, difficult to manage, and unaccommodating to changes in our lives.

This is why we started Scratch. We wanted to reinvent the loan servicing industry, well—from scratch. We wanted to create a world where debt plays a healthier and less taxing role in more people's lives. By bringing world-class product and technical thinking to a multi-trillion industry that hasn't seen innovation in well over two decades, Scratch's platform empowers borrowers to have greater control, visibility and flexibility over their financial health, removing the traditional loan servicer from the equation altogether and bringing borrowers closer to their lenders.

Our team is rapidly growing and comes from diverse backgrounds including Dropbox, Pinterest, Prosper, Bloomberg and Ripple. Our office is based in San Francisco.

With a rapidly growing community of lenders and borrowers, we think it's time the world knows there's a better way to pay back their loans. We'd love for you to join in our mission and help play a role in changing the way we experience debt for the better!

Scratch’s backend presents many interesting challenges and opportunities for designing and architecting complex systems. You and your team will work on high-stakes engineering challenges that will shape the future of loan servicing and debt. What's at stake? Scratch aims to be the source of truth for trillions of dollars. It's crucial that our novel platform ensures accuracy and precision on non-trivial math down to seven decimal places with zero data loss or security compromises, resiliency to handle a large number of loans at scale as well as the flexibility to handle new and innovative financial instruments.

About the role:
Architect and scale complex systems like our loan servicing engine and time-series database.
Design core pieces of Scratch’s infrastructure, optimizing for long-term maintainability, performance, and reliability.
Build and scale systems for monitoring, tracing, profiling, debugging, and deploying.
Take full ownership and responsibility for building, shipping, and maintaining core Scratch features, end-to-end.

You may be a good fit if:
6+ years industry experience You have experience in databases, distributed systems, and backend performance measurement and optimization.
You have experience leading engineering projects.
You derive joy from refactoring and abstracting in order to make complex systems fun to develop on and easy to understand.
You have a strong background in computer science and mathematics.

We want you!

If you made it this far, chances are you’re as excited about working to change how people experience debt as we are—and we love that. Please apply even if you’re unsure about whether you meet every single requirement in this posting. Scratch is looking for smart, intellectually curious people who are invested in our mission, not just those who can “check all the boxes”.

Uber,Sr. Software Engineer - Mobile Platform,"Los Angeles, CA","Sr. Software Engineer - Mobile Platform, Uber, Los Angeles, CA, Remote, Hide job, 8 connections work here, 1 week ago, 0 applicants","About The Team

We are open to Software Engineer II, Sr Software Engineer, and Staff Engineer levels.

Mobile Foundations and Developer Experience is a unique team that works on the foundational libraries, frameworks and dev tools that our ~600 mobile engineers use at Uber, and external companies via our open source libraries (Swift, Objective-C & Kotlin).

Our team has an unusually large amount of autonomy and a wide mandate compared to most teams in the industry, so there is always something interesting to work on. We are looking for highly passionate engineers or managers who care a lot about the practice of software development itself and who want to create a high amount of impact both within and outside of Uber.

Since we are an engineering infrastructure team, we are not really driven by product focused PMs telling us what to do. We look to our engineers to notice issues and think of solutions to such issues in our foundational libraries and things we can do to improve the developer experience at Uber. We are guided by what our engineers need, helped by various surveys and day to day interactions, but we still have to figure out the solutions to fulfill their needs. We work closely with other application platform teams as our main customers.

Major Goals of the Team
Fast build & iteration speeds for all Uber’s mobile engineers.
Remote development environments, somewhat similar to Gitpod.
Common frameworks and tooling to improve build speed, feature development speed and fun/developer morale, such as our Base UI mobile widget library.
Market mobile development at Uber via conferences, blog articles, twitter and open source software releases.
We also have sister teams with similar goals for other development platforms such as Web, Go and Java Backend.
How The Team Works
We are a US remote friendly team. If you live somewhere in the USA, we can hire you!
We don’t have a high meeting load, about 2 - 4 hrs/week for a typical engineer.
We are not a process heavy team, no weekly JIRA ticket scrums and story points for us!
Our on call is mostly a 9a-5pm support on call, you don’t have to worry about getting woken up in the middle of the night.
Our projects and our team is a marathon, not a sprint. We try to keep a sustainable working pace and hours to avoid burnout.
Our tech stack is fairly standard or usable at other companies, you will gain a lot of transferable skills if you work with us.
We are open source friendly. We’ve released multiple projects on github here at Uber in Swift, Objective-C & Kotlin.
In manager 1:1s we try to develop a mentor/coach type relationship and try to help you with your career or whatever else you want help developing on. We understand how promotion works and work to help you on that path if you are interested.
There is a ton of possible work to do and scope to take on, you are not limited by the scope of the team if you really care to work on ambitious projects! You will have a lot of influence on the future direction of the Uber mobile tech stack, which can reach out and influence the mobile industry as a whole as a result.
Uber is not a company that has strict siloing, engineers and teams can start and work on projects outside of the typical charter of their team, or work on projects that might be the charter of other teams.
The work you would do as a mobile platform developer is what I would call a ‘middle-end’ developer. Not a backend server developer, not a front end UI developer, but the person that works on the foundational parts of frontend apps. This means while you often are building mobile code, you often need to go beyond just the mobile stack and go into things like build systems and other software platforms and write things like networking libraries or UI toolkits.
Our Tech Stack

Uber’s mobile apps use a standard shared software architecture called RIBs, which is a simplified VIPER variant. We use ReactiveX streams heavily throughout our apps and all of our apps use a shared set of standard Uber libraries to do things like log uploading, networking or create Uber style widgets, called the Presidio library set. A large part of that library is our Base UI Mobile library (The mobile version is not public, only the web one, thus the link to the web one). We also use Dagger style dependency injection in our apps, using our own open source libraries called Motif & Needle.

We use Bazel as our build system and have a lot of custom IDE extensions and optimizations for our respective platforms. Our engineers still use their industry standard IDEs to develop code. We use Buildkite as our CI management system along with our home built SubmitQueue (slides) system. We use Phabricator for code review, but will be migrating to another platform in the future.
Android
Kotlin is the standard language to write new code.
We have a lot of Java code still in our Android codebase since adding Kotlin support is relatively new compared to iOS’s adoption of Swift.
Our minimum Android version is low, but we also use compatibility libraries to let you use the latest Android features.
We use RxJava + RxKotlin extensively in our apps, along with our Motif DI framework.
Jetpack Compose is fully supported in our apps and engineers can use it to make new UI screens now.
Most engineers use IntelliJ with Buck as the background build system, but we will have Android Studio support soon along with using Bazel.
Android engineers can spin up devpods, which are like gitpods, so they can do remote development with Jetbrains Projector / Gateway on large beefy rackmount machines.
iOS
Swift is our standard language.
We have some legacy Objective-C code but that isn’t modified much.
Our apps work with iOS 15 with an iOS 13 minimum deployment target.
We update our apps to the n+1 iOS version fairly quickly once they are public and stable. We then bump the minimum iOS version by n+1 too.
We use RxSwift extensively in our apps, along with our Needle DI framework.
We are prototyping SwiftUI and creating some pretty interesting libraries for it.
Most engineers use Xcode, we use Bazel as a background build system to further improve build times, but it’s fairly transparent to most engineers.
We are developing a vscode IDE called uCode so we can do a lot of cool things that wouldn’t be possible in Xcode and are investigating something like devpods for iOS.
What We Are Looking For From Engineering Candidates
The best kind of engineer on our team is a person who really cares about the practice of software development itself and has an interest in dev tools and foundational libraries.
We are looking for engineers who have experience with iOS or Android Mobile Software Development.
If you have this experience background, you will need to have worked on apps that have shipped to a respective app store.
AND / OR engineers who have experience with development tools or maintaining and extending a CI/CD system, which does not necessarily require mobile software development experience.
Dev tools / CI experience can be:
Build systems, such as xcbuild, gradle, bazel/buck/pants/blaze, etc.
Build farms, remote development environments.
IDEs, Text Editors, IDE/Editor extensions
CI: Jenkins, Buildkite, Github Actions or similar
Compilers, linters, static analysis tools, etc.
Git and other DVCS experience
Even though you might not come from the above backgrounds, if you are interested in dev tools and improving the practice of software development itself, then we will probably still be interested in you! Much of the dev tools we work with are fairly specialized, so we expect to train and onboard engineers onto that tooling anyway. Do you come from game dev, or really nerded out on things like rust as a hobby? Give us a shot anyway!
Our ideal candidate would be a mobile engineer with devtool experience and has worked in an iOS or Android dev tools team at a large tech company that ships large mobile applications, such as Airbnb, Twitter, Pinterest, Linkedin, Facebook, Apple, Google, etc.
What a Software Engineer Will Do On Our Team
Create new software or improve our existing software systems.
Write design documents and general documentation
Answer support questions about our team's products to other engineers in the company.
Work with other engineers to create or improve our dev tools and foundational libraries.
Learn about new systems outside your initial region of expertise. (Ex: If you're an iOS engineer, learning about iOS dev tooling. If your a CI / dev tools engineer, learning about mobile software development, etc)
Basic Qualifications
iOS, Android, Developer Tools or CI/CD Software Engineering Experience
If you have iOS or Android software development, you will need have worked on an app that has been published to your respective app stores.
If you have CI/CD software engineering experience, you must have the ability to code and create CI/CD software systems, not just have ops experience.
Preferred Qualifications
Work experience on an architecture, foundations, platform, developer tools, developer experience, CI/CD, compliers, linters, release, build, IDE, code editor or other team of that type.
Have worked at a medium or large company on the above type of team.",1 week ago

Knoetic cultural values

Written by our founder in 2020.

Intellectual curiosity: I want to surround myself with people who are endlessly curious, who are always asking questions, who are fascinated with understanding others and the world around them. We're the kids who grew up always asking ""Why?""

Intellectual humility: I want to work with people who embrace the scientific method, who go into conversations with an open mind and ear, who are looking for ways to sharpen their thinking, who are delighted to find out when they're wrong rather than invested in defending why they're right.

Relentless resourcefulness: Our company should be full of people who will run through walls to get to their goals, who will bring more solutions than problems to others, who will figure out a way to succeed no matter what.

Winning: We are ambitious, and we want to win. We don't want a trophy for effort or for ""good enough"" - we want it for first place

Positive impact on others: There are people, who by the very virtue of their presence, make everyone else around them a better person. It could be because they have unwaveringly high standards. Or are incredible givers that inspire generosity. Or are teachers of their peers. However they do it, they push others upwards. They are culture accretive; their very presence makes everyone else step up their game.

Speed: We're a team with a bias for action (paired with good judgment), a desire to get more done faster, because we know it's the only way we'll win.

Positivity: You know it when you see it - can-do, optimistic. That doesn't mean everyone doesn't have down moments - it just means on balance, you walk away from your interactions with them energized and charged up to do more with your life.

Continuous improvement: We're always making ourselves better. Stasis is the enemy… if you're not going forwards, you're going backwards. Everything is a work-in-progress in perpetuity - yourself included.

Note - even if you don't check every box in the job description, we still encourage you to apply!

Knoetic is committed to fostering an inclusive workplace, and does not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity, age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, protected veteran status, or any legally protected status. If you're missing a few qualifications or don't have the exact experience listed above, you may still be the next right candidate for this role or another role we have open at Knoetic!

Scratch's mission is to build a repayment platform to change the way consumers experience debt. Most of us take on debt to help us get ahead, or in many cases, to not fall behind. But for most of us—despite its necessity—once we have debt, it doesn't play a healthy role in our lives. It can be hard to understand, difficult to manage, and unaccommodating to changes in our lives.

This is why we started Scratch. We wanted to reinvent the loan servicing industry, well—from scratch. We wanted to create a world where debt plays a healthier and less taxing role in more people's lives. By bringing world-class product and technical thinking to a multi-trillion industry that hasn't seen innovation in well over two decades, Scratch's platform empowers borrowers to have greater control, visibility and flexibility over their financial health, removing the traditional loan servicer from the equation altogether and bringing borrowers closer to their lenders.

Our team is rapidly growing and comes from diverse backgrounds including Dropbox, Pinterest, Prosper, Bloomberg and Ripple. Our office is based in San Francisco.

With a rapidly growing community of lenders and borrowers, we think it's time the world knows there's a better way to pay back their loans. We'd love for you to join in our mission and help play a role in changing the way we experience debt for the better!

Scratch’s backend and frontend presents many interesting challenges and opportunities for designing and architecting complex systems. Our APIs and user experience caters to both many personas: Enterprise (Lenders, Creditors), Consumers (Borrowers, Internal Operations). You and your team will work on high-stakes engineering challenges that will shape the future of loan servicing and debt. What's at stake? Scratch aims to be the source of truth for trillions of dollars. It's crucial that our novel platform ensures accuracy and precision on non-trivial math down to seven decimal places with zero data loss or security compromises, resiliency to handle a large number of loans at scale as well as the flexibility to handle new and innovative financial instruments.

About the role:

Design core pieces of Scratch’s APIs and user experiences, optimizing for long-term maintainability, performance, and reliability.
You will work across multiple personas: lenders, creditors, borrowers and internal users.
Take full ownership and responsibility for building, shipping, and maintaining core Scratch APIs, end-to-end.

You may be a good fit if:

2+ years industry experience.
You enjoy being a generalist working on both the frontend, backend, and anything it takes to solve problems and delight users both internally and externally.
You have a strong background in computer science.

We want you!

If you made it this far, chances are you’re as excited about working to change how people experience debt as we are—and we love that. Please apply even if you’re unsure about whether you meet every single requirement in this posting. Scratch is looking for smart, intellectually curious people who are invested in our mission, not just those who can “check all the boxes”.

Benefits we Provide:

Health insurance: We cover 99% of your healthcare premiums and 70% of your dependent’s premiums and offer competitive medical, dental, and vision insurance plans.
Learning and development stipend: We offer a $1,500 per year stipend for your personal career development!
Wellness benefit: We’re proud to provide employees a $100/month pre-tax credit towards any gym or fitness program.
Catered lunches and snacks: We have high-quality catered lunches every day and well-stocked kitchens.
Generous PTO (including your birthday!), sick leave, and parental leave
401k program: We offer a 401k program!
Additional benefits: We offer each employee the opportunity to enroll in pre-tax benefits, such as commuter benefits and an FSA account.",2 weeks ago

Abnormal Security,Backend Engineer,United States,"Backend Engineer, Abnormal Security, United States, Remote, Hide job, 3 alumni work here, 2 weeks ago, Easy Apply","The Opportunity:
Abnormal Security’s Account Takeover team is defining the next generation of security for Software as a Service and cloud offerings. Enterprises of all sizes have begun to adopt cloud offerings from google docs to box to slack: work that once took place in a single office building or behind a firewall is now happening out on the open internet, and criminals are very aware of the opportunities to steal data, hijack important financial information, and otherwise compromise companies that use these cloud services. Help us build a new layer of protection that will give enterprises the same level of security for their cloud offerings as Abnormal Security’s industry leading products do in the email security space.

We’re looking to add a Founding Backend Engineer to our team, who will work alongside our CTO, Sanjay Jeyakumar, and collaborate with our world-class team. The individual in this role will shape and elevate our Account Takeover team by building backend, scalable systems from scratch, and by attracting, learning from, and mentoring others on the team. This role straddles the line of velocity and excellence.


As a Founding Backend Engineer of the ATO team, you will:
Build an ingestion platform which will intake +1B events from 3rd party APIs per day this year and scale to +100B events/day next year.
Build an anomaly detection pipeline that will detect rare suspicious activity (one in a million) with +95% precision & <1minute latency on the aforementioned event stream
Build a data platform to store the event & detection data (+1TB per day) and provide real time transactional and analytical access
Create a magical work environment with colleagues and memorable interview process for candidates


This is a unique opportunity in which engineers from various backgrounds could thrive. Here are just a few examples of profiles we think could be excellent:
A backend generalist who wants to deepen their skills in real-time backend architectures and data engineering
A backend specialist who has spent time building pieces of something, but now wants more ownership designing a system from end-to-end
An aspiring entrepreneur who wants a rare opportunity to sit alongside our CTO to build a startup within a scale-up.
A start-up fanatic who enjoys working on early-stage teams and building products from 0 to 1, but also wants to see what it’s like to work at a company at scale
An engineer who wants to build a product from 0 to 1, while launching a new company “office” in the UK for a well-funded, top-VC-backed, US scale-up.


This position is not:
A management position - although, we believe everyone leads by example.
A good fit for someone who wants to solve technical problems that don’t solve a business problem or who is more interested in research than applied engineering
A specialist who wants to deepen their skills in one particular area (that will come with time, but not quite yet)


Requirements:
Strong Computer Science fundamentals
We prefer candidates who have at least 2-12 years of experience working with scalable and performant cloud-native distributed systems


There are a lot of opportunities for growth and career advancement–it’s up to you own your career here. Some potential career paths for this role include:
Continuing to grow into a senior, staff, and/or tech lead individual contributor role
Moving from an individual contributor role into an Engineering Management position
Positioning yourself to learn a ton, build an insanely great network, so you can be a Founder of your own company


We’re a tight-knit group of diverse, boundary-breaking colleagues, where everyone feels welcome and can contribute the best work of their careers. You might be a culture-add if the following describes you:
You’re a fast learner who moves swiftly and autonomously, iterating on your learnings in real-time. You don’t need knowledge or experience in cyber security, but you should be excited about the mission and eager to learn about the industry quickly. You have a deeply-embedded kinetic drive that propels them to make the impossible possible.
You are an owner who takes full responsibility for your work. You are not a problem shuffler. You understand how your work impacts the business and proactively seek information to stay informed and act as a business owner, in which there is no task beneath you.
You are authentic – clear about your opinions, motivations, and intent. You are curious, not judgmental, and always seek to learn more so you can improve your understanding of the world.
You love building technology solutions that delight customers - internal and external alike. Yes, sometimes that means you are okay working late or rising early.
You take a principle-based approach to building products/processes. You are intentional about improving 1% better everyday. You have high standards, we do too.


For us to realize our ambition as a company, we are going to need to do more, do better, and grow faster than any company has in our industry. This growth and our future ambition require more leadership and talent than we have today. Below are the guiding principles and the behavioral values that we look for in all company leaders:
Velocity: to move fast, make decisions quickly to help us outpace attackers and outpace our competition (even if we make mistakes)
Ownership: to empower ourselves to step up as leaders and take initiative with responsibility (even outside our comfort zone)
Intellectual Honesty: to be curious and open-minded about the world, to fearlessly, and respectively share our beliefs (even if awkward)
Customer Obsession: to always work backward from customer priorities to help focus our work (even if we feel like we know better)
Excellence: to constantly push and challenge ourselves to achieve our ambition of being the best (even if it feels overwhelming at times)


We offer you:
The opportunity to be part of a truly special team (we have 4.9 stars on both Glassdoor and Gartner Reviews). Our veteran team has built some of the most enduring machine learning platforms at leading companies including Google, Twitter, Pinterest, Amazon, Microsoft, and Expanse. Our customer base includes multiple Fortune 500 companies.
A remote-first work policy. We are remote-first, but have optional working spaces in San Francisco, NYC, Utah, Seattle, Singapore, and UK/I. Safety permitting, host in-person meet-ups and company-wide offsites.
A competitive compensation package: We grant each employee a base salary, performance bonus, and equity.
Employee Benefits: By this point, we hope you can see that we care about our employees. Benefits vary slightly by location because of, well, laws, but feel free to share what’s important to you and we will happily tell you how we can support you in your personal and professional journey! Yes, we have health care, work-from-home-stipends, unlimited time off, health and wellness stipends, learning stipends, team-bonding budgets etc etc :)

It can be hard to understand, difficult to manage, and unaccommodating to changes in our lives.

This is why we started Scratch. We wanted to reinvent the loan servicing industry, well—from scratch. We wanted to create a world where debt plays a healthier and less taxing role in more people's lives. By bringing world-class product and technical thinking to a multi-trillion industry that hasn't seen innovation in well over two decades, Scratch's platform empowers borrowers to have greater control, visibility and flexibility over their financial health, removing the traditional loan servicer from the equation altogether and bringing borrowers closer to their lenders.

Our team is rapidly growing and comes from diverse backgrounds including Dropbox, Pinterest, Prosper, Bloomberg and Ripple. Our office is based in San Francisco.

Scratch's mission is to build a repayment platform to change the way consumers experience debt. Most of us take on debt to help us get ahead, or in many cases, to not fall behind. But for most of us---despite its necessity---once we have debt, it doesn't play a healthy role in our lives. It can be hard to understand, difficult to manage, and unaccommodating to changes in our lives.

This is why we started Scratch. We wanted to reinvent the loan servicing industry, well---from scratch. We wanted to create a world where debt plays a healthier and less taxing role in more people's lives. By bringing world-class product and technical thinking to a multi-trillion industry that hasn't seen innovation in well over two decades, Scratch's platform empowers borrowers to have greater control, visibility and flexibility over their financial health, removing the traditional loan servicer from the equation altogether and bringing borrowers closer to their lenders.

Our team is rapidly growing and comes from diverse backgrounds including Dropbox, Pinterest, Prosper, Bloomberg and Ripple. Our office is based in San Francisco.
With a rapidly growing community of lenders and borrowers, we think it's time the world knows there's a better way to pay back their loans. We'd love for you to join in our mission and help play a role in changing the way we experience debt for the better!
Scratch's backend presents many interesting challenges and opportunities for designing and architecting complex systems. You and your team will work on high-stakes engineering challenges that will shape the future of loan servicing and debt. What's at stake? Scratch aims to be the source of truth for trillions of dollars. It's crucial that our novel platform ensures accuracy and precision on non-trivial math down to seven decimal places with zero data loss or security compromises, resiliency to handle a large number of loans at scale as well as the flexibility to handle new and innovative financial instruments.

About the role:
Architect and scale complex systems like our loan servicing engine and time-series database.
Design core pieces of Scratch’s infrastructure, optimizing for long-term maintainability, performance, and reliability.
Build and scale systems for monitoring, tracing, profiling, debugging, and deploying.
Take full ownership and responsibility for building, shipping, and maintaining core Scratch features, end-to-end.

You may be a good fit if:
2+ years industry experience
You have experience in databases, distributed systems, and backend performance measurement and optimization.
You have experience leading engineering projects.
You derive joy from refactoring and abstracting in order to make complex systems fun to develop on and easy to understand.
You have a strong background in computer science and mathematics.

We want you!
If you made it this far, chances are you're as excited about working to change how people experience debt as we are---and we love that. Please apply even if you're unsure about whether you meet every single requirement in this posting. Scratch is looking for smart, intellectually curious people who are invested in our mission, not just those who can ""check all the boxes"".

Health insurance: We cover 99% of your healthcare premiums and 70% of your dependent's premiums and offer competitive medical, dental, and vision insurance plans.

Job Title: Senior Software Engineer
Reports to: Senior Director of Engineering
Location:

FranklinCovey Summary
Franklin Covey Co. (NYSE: FC) is one of the world's largest leadership companies with 1,000 employees, 1,500 clients and 2,000,000+ learners. We help organizations achieve greatness on the four people-related challenges that matter most: leadership, individual effectiveness, culture and business processes. Our unique approach combines content, technology and people to generate collective behavior change at scale. Our core product, the FranklinCovey All Access Pass®, provides companies access to 20+ courses in multiple modalities and in >20 languages. The All Access Pass has grown from $0 to $100MM in recurring revenue in the last five years, making it among the fastest growing products in edtech.

Role Context
Historically FC primarily offered in-person, one-off training. Over the last five years we have made substantial investments, and have had significant success, transitioning the business to an online, subscription product (AAP). In April ‘21 we acquired Strive, an edtech startup whose leadership development platform was used by leading tech cos like Slack, Airbnb, Pinterest and Intuit. Under the Strive's team direction and leadership, we are doubling down on the technology/product-centric approach and looking to build out a larger product and engineering team.

Role Summary
As a Senior Software Engineer, you will build products to help organizations train their employees and overcome their most pressing people-related problems at scale. You will work with product, design, data, and content teams to build a modern learning platform, scaling usage (and impact) 10-100x in the next year.

Core Job Responsibilities
Ideate: Engineers participate early in the product development process. You will review regular quantitative and qualitative research about our clients and learners and weigh in on the product strategy and roadmap.
Collaborate: You will partner with product, data and design to define the product features and functionality to ensure we're building the right thing at the right time and in the right way.
Build: You will ship regularly and iteratively, writing testable, readable and maintainable code.
Review & Architect: As a Senior Software Engineer you will play a leadership role in code reviews for the team, helping set the engineer bar, defining best practices, and weighing in on major architecture decisions.
Support: You will work with the sales, marketing, implementation and support teams to ensure users get the most value from the products you've built.

Job Requirements
5-10 years of experience building and shipping high-quality products (years of experience ≠ ability, so we'll use this as a proxy but not a hard requirement).
Back-end experience with Node.js, Python (Django), or Ruby on Rails and front-end experience with React preferred but not required. We're looking for great engineers and are confident that you can learn the language with time and direction.
Drive to continually improve and share knowledge with your teammates.
Ability and experience mentoring/guiding/developing more junior engineers with code reviews, best practice sharing, and architecture decisions.
Experience with performance, security, privacy, accessibility, and localization/globalization preferred but not required.
Experience architecting or refactoring systems of moderate complexity preferred but not required.

Why We Think This is a Great Opportunity
Interesting Product, Technical and Organizational Challenges – This year we will increase the number of users on Strive's learning platform 100 to 1000x. This will require us to solve a number of interesting product, technical and organizational challenges – whatever your unique interest is, there's likely a good challenge for you to work on.
Impact at Scale – FranklinCovey positively impacts the lives of millions of learners and tens of millions of their direct reports every year – FC directly teaches 4x as many learners in the US as all US business schools combined! By building out platform integrations for learning and planning in the flow of work, you'll substantially increase the quality of the learning experience and thus improve the skills and experiences of that enormous audience.
Startup Speed, Established Company Security – FranklinCovey's product & tech org is small relative to the company's learner/client scale, so you'll be able to move quickly to build a strategy and ship great products. Unlike a startup, FC is an established (and profitable!) publicly traded company, so you won't worry about the next funding round falling through and a lack of job security.

Company Information
Franklin Covey Co. (NYSE: FC) is a global, public company, specializing in organizational performance improvement. We help organizations achieve results that require lasting changes in human behavior. Our world-class solutions enable greatness in individuals, teams and organizations and are accessible through the FranklinCovey All Access Pass® available in multiple modalities and in 21 languages.

Atlassian can hire people in any country where we have a legal entity. Assuming you have eligible working rights and a sufficient time zone overlap with your team, you can choose to work remotely or return to an office as they reopen (unless it’s necessary for your role to be performed in the office). Interviews and onboarding are conducted virtually, a part of being a distributed-first company.

Halp is looking for a talented Full Stack Software Engineer with a knack for solving problems and a passion for helping team members and customers. Our product and engineering team builds software that helps technical operations teams dramatically reduce ticket resolution time, increase user satisfaction, and amplify productivity. Every engineer at Halp touches all parts of our product lifecycle and has input into developing the future of our SaaS product suite.

As a Full Stack Software Engineer, you will play an essential role in evolving Halp, making a large impact on our rapidly growing product. We seek out action-oriented individuals that aren’t afraid to voice their opinion and value healthy debate as much as collaboration.

You will contribute to the core of Halp, surfacing intuitive experiences inside Slack and our web product to create and triage tickets that impact more than 100,000 employees at future-thinking companies like Slack, Pinterest, and GitHub.

Understand the reasoning behind key product and design decisions and contribute good solutions to implementation and architecture discussions.
Support fellow engineers through peer code reviews and constructive discussions that concern architecture, data model, and feature implementation decisions.
Take initiative to drive new projects, reduce complexity, and unblock others.
Collaborate with cross-functional team members to influence product strategy and direction.
Lead key initiatives to improve a product that our customers seriously love. Seriously. See what Josh Senick, Senior Manager, Business Technology Operations, Slack, had to say about Halp: “The second I saw it, I said where do I sign? How do we get this, because this is exactly what I want to do. This is the tool I’ve been wanting since my first day at Slack.""

Who You Are
A results-oriented engineer who is comfortable with higher levels of ambiguity
A proactive communicator with great follow-through
Excited about learning from your coworkers and collaborating with people with diverse perspectives
Willing to voice your opinion but okay with not always being right
Trend towards focusing on the customer problem and treating technology as a means to an end

Requirements
At least 3 years of experience in an engineering role at a software company
An extensive background in front-end engineering and API design and implementation
Able to technically lead a product initiative from design to production
Able to guide scaling a platform across distributed services
Strong competency in all of the following: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, TypeScript, GraphQL, MongoDB

Nice To Have
Experience working with help desk or ticketing platforms

Abnormal Security,Full Stack Engineer,United States,"Full Stack Engineer, Abnormal Security, United States, Remote, Hide job, 3 alumni work here, 2 weeks ago, Easy Apply","The Opportunity
Abnormal Security’s Account Takeover team is defining the next generation of security for Software as a Service and cloud offerings. Enterprises of all sizes have begun to adopt cloud offerings from google docs to box to slack: work that once took place in a single office building or behind a firewall is now happening out on the open internet, and criminals are very aware of the opportunities to steal data, hijack important financial information, and otherwise compromise companies that use these cloud services. Help us build a new layer of protection that will give enterprises the same level of security for their cloud offerings as Abnormal Security’s industry leading products do in the email security space.

We’re looking to add a Founding Full-Stack Engineer to our new business unit, who will work alongside our CTO, Sanjay Jeyakumar, and collaborate with our world-class team. The individual in this role will shape and elevate our Account Takeover (ATO) team by streamlining the layers of our architecture while working closely with our customers–internal and external alike. This role straddles the line of velocity and excellence.
As a Founding Full-Stack Engineer of the A23 team, you will:
Own and develop data-rich, consumer-grade, user interfaces and APIs for integrating third party solutions into Abnormal’s unified cloud protection product
Build the user interface that allows customers and internal agents to debug particular attacks
Build a framework and specification for quickly adding new data sources, and then integrate the first data sources as proof of concept for our customers
Obsessively partner with our customers to gather their feedback and quickly iterate to improve our systems - example - help resolve FP/FN or integration issues.
Create a magical work environment with colleagues and memorable interview process for candidates
This is a full stack role: expect to move from tasks such as coding the UI for our customer portal one day, while spending the next working on the data integration platform that pulls in logs and events from cloud offerings, or perhaps diving into the ML systems used to detect attacks. Additionally, we will be building this with heavy customer input and are looking for someone excited to deal with customers, taking their feedback to quickly iterate and improve our systems.
This is a unique opportunity in which engineers from various backgrounds could thrive. Here are just a few examples of profiles we think could be excellent:
A full stack engineer who has worked at scale and enjoys building products from the ground up
A customer-focused engineer who loves the idea of getting directly involved with our users to hear what’s working and what isn’t
An aspiring entrepreneur who wants a rare opportunity to sit alongside our CTO to build a startup within a scale-up.
A full-stack generalist who has spent time building pieces of something, but who wants more ownership designing a system from end-to-end
Requirements:
Strong Computer Science fundamentals
We prefer candidates who have at least 3 years of experience building & operating scalable web applications with modern frontend frameworks
There are a lot of opportunities for growth and career advancement–it’s up to you own your career here. Some potential career paths for this role include:
Continuing to grow into a senior, staff, and/or tech lead individual contributor role
Moving from an individual contributor role into an Engineering Management position
Positioning yourself to learn a ton, build an insanely great network, so you can be a Founder of your own company
We’re a tight-knit group of diverse, boundary-breaking colleagues, where everyone feels welcome and can contribute the best work of their careers. You might be a culture-add if the following describes you:
You’re a fast learner who moves swiftly and autonomously, iterating on your learnings in real-time. You don’t need knowledge or experience in cyber security, but you should be excited about the mission and eager to learn about the industry quickly. You have a deeply-embedded kinetic drive that propels them to make the impossible possible.
You are an owner who takes full responsibility for your work. You are not a problem shuffler. You understand how your work impacts the business and proactively seek information to stay informed and act as a business owner, in which there is no task beneath you.
You are authentic – clear about your opinions, motivations, and intent. You are curious, not judgmental, and always seek to learn more so you can improve your understanding of the world.
You love building technology solutions that delight customers - internal and external alike. Yes, sometimes that means you are okay working late or rising early.
You take a principle-based approach to building products/processes. You are intentional about improving 1% better everyday. You have high standards, we do too.
For us to realize our ambition as a company, we are going to need to do more, do better, and grow faster than any company has in our industry. This growth and our future ambition require more leadership and talent than we have today. Below are the guiding principles and the behavioral values that we look for in all company leaders:
Velocity: to move fast, make decisions quickly to help us outpace attackers and outpace our competition
(even if we make mistakes)
Ownership: to empower ourselves to step up as leaders and take initiative with responsibility (even outside our comfort zone)
Intellectual Honesty: to be curious and open-minded about the world, to fearlessly, and respectively share
our beliefs (even if awkward)
Customer Obsession: to always work backward from customer priorities to help focus our work (even if we
feel like we know better)
Excellence: to constantly push and challenge ourselves to achieve our ambition of being the best (even if it
feels overwhelming at times)
Tech Stack:
Language: Python
Platform: AWS (Azure in the future) through Terraform, Docker, ECS
Frameworks: Django, Celery
Storage: MySQL, Postgres, Redis
Frontend: Typescript, React

Uber,Sr. Software Engineer - Mobile Platform,United States,"Sr. Software Engineer - Mobile Platform, Uber, United States, Remote, Hide job, 8 connections work here, 1 week ago, 9 applicants","About The Team

We are open to Software Engineer II, Sr Software Engineer, and Staff Engineer levels.

Mobile Foundations and Developer Experience is a unique team that works on the foundational libraries, frameworks and dev tools that our ~600 mobile engineers use at Uber, and external companies via our open source libraries (Swift, Objective-C & Kotlin).

Our team has an unusually large amount of autonomy and a wide mandate compared to most teams in the industry, so there is always something interesting to work on. We are looking for highly passionate engineers or managers who care a lot about the practice of software development itself and who want to create a high amount of impact both within and outside of Uber.

Since we are an engineering infrastructure team, we are not really driven by product focused PMs telling us what to do. We look to our engineers to notice issues and think of solutions to such issues in our foundational libraries and things we can do to improve the developer experience at Uber. We are guided by what our engineers need, helped by various surveys and day to day interactions, but we still have to figure out the solutions to fulfill their needs. We work closely with other application platform teams as our main customers.

Major Goals of the Team
Fast build & iteration speeds for all Uber’s mobile engineers.
Remote development environments, somewhat similar to Gitpod.
Common frameworks and tooling to improve build speed, feature development speed and fun/developer morale, such as our Base UI mobile widget library.
Market mobile development at Uber via conferences, blog articles, twitter and open source software releases.
We also have sister teams with similar goals for other development platforms such as Web, Go and Java Backend.
How The Team Works
We are a US remote friendly team. If you live somewhere in the USA, we can hire you!
We don’t have a high meeting load, about 2 - 4 hrs/week for a typical engineer.
We are not a process heavy team, no weekly JIRA ticket scrums and story points for us!
Our on call is mostly a 9a-5pm support on call, you don’t have to worry about getting woken up in the middle of the night.
Our projects and our team is a marathon, not a sprint. We try to keep a sustainable working pace and hours to avoid burnout.
Our tech stack is fairly standard or usable at other companies, you will gain a lot of transferable skills if you work with us.
We are open source friendly. We’ve released multiple projects on github here at Uber in Swift, Objective-C & Kotlin.
In manager 1:1s we try to develop a mentor/coach type relationship and try to help you with your career or whatever else you want help developing on. We understand how promotion works and work to help you on that path if you are interested.
There is a ton of possible work to do and scope to take on, you are not limited by the scope of the team if you really care to work on ambitious projects! You will have a lot of influence on the future direction of the Uber mobile tech stack, which can reach out and influence the mobile industry as a whole as a result.
Uber is not a company that has strict siloing, engineers and teams can start and work on projects outside of the typical charter of their team, or work on projects that might be the charter of other teams.
The work you would do as a mobile platform developer is what I would call a ‘middle-end’ developer. Not a backend server developer, not a front end UI developer, but the person that works on the foundational parts of frontend apps. This means while you often are building mobile code, you often need to go beyond just the mobile stack and go into things like build systems and other software platforms and write things like networking libraries or UI toolkits.
Our Tech Stack

Uber’s mobile apps use a standard shared software architecture called RIBs, which is a simplified VIPER variant. We use ReactiveX streams heavily throughout our apps and all of our apps use a shared set of standard Uber libraries to do things like log uploading, networking or create Uber style widgets, called the Presidio library set. A large part of that library is our Base UI Mobile library (The mobile version is not public, only the web one, thus the link to the web one). We also use Dagger style dependency injection in our apps, using our own open source libraries called Motif & Needle.

We use Bazel as our build system and have a lot of custom IDE extensions and optimizations for our respective platforms. Our engineers still use their industry standard IDEs to develop code. We use Buildkite as our CI management system along with our home built SubmitQueue (slides) system. We use Phabricator for code review, but will be migrating to another platform in the future.
Android
Kotlin is the standard language to write new code.
We have a lot of Java code still in our Android codebase since adding Kotlin support is relatively new compared to iOS’s adoption of Swift.
Our minimum Android version is low, but we also use compatibility libraries to let you use the latest Android features.
We use RxJava + RxKotlin extensively in our apps, along with our Motif DI framework.
Jetpack Compose is fully supported in our apps and engineers can use it to make new UI screens now.
Most engineers use IntelliJ with Buck as the background build system, but we will have Android Studio support soon along with using Bazel.
Android engineers can spin up devpods, which are like gitpods, so they can do remote development with Jetbrains Projector / Gateway on large beefy rackmount machines.
iOS
Swift is our standard language.
We have some legacy Objective-C code but that isn’t modified much.
Our apps work with iOS 15 with an iOS 13 minimum deployment target.
We update our apps to the n+1 iOS version fairly quickly once they are public and stable. We then bump the minimum iOS version by n+1 too.
We use RxSwift extensively in our apps, along with our Needle DI framework.
We are prototyping SwiftUI and creating some pretty interesting libraries for it.

What We Are Looking For From Engineering Candidates
The best kind of engineer on our team is a person who really cares about the practice of software development itself and has an interest in dev tools and foundational libraries.
We are looking for engineers who have experience with iOS or Android Mobile Software Development.
If you have this experience background, you will need to have worked on apps that have shipped to a respective app store.
AND / OR engineers who have experience with development tools or maintaining and extending a CI/CD system, which does not necessarily require mobile software development experience.
Dev tools / CI experience can be:
Build systems, such as xcbuild, gradle, bazel/buck/pants/blaze, etc.
Build farms, remote development environments.
IDEs, Text Editors, IDE/Editor extensions
CI: Jenkins, Buildkite, Github Actions or similar
Compilers, linters, static analysis tools, etc.
Git and other DVCS experience
Even though you might not come from the above backgrounds, if you are interested in dev tools and improving the practice of software development itself, then we will probably still be interested in you! Much of the dev tools we work with are fairly specialized, so we expect to train and onboard engineers onto that tooling anyway. Do you come from game dev, or really nerded out on things like rust as a hobby? Give us a shot anyway!
Our ideal candidate would be a mobile engineer with devtool experience and has worked in an iOS or Android dev tools team at a large tech company that ships large mobile applications, such as Airbnb, Twitter, Pinterest, Linkedin, Facebook, Apple, Google, etc.
What a Software Engineer Will Do On Our Team
Create new software or improve our existing software systems.
Write design documents and general documentation
Answer support questions about our team's products to other engineers in the company.
Work with other engineers to create or improve our dev tools and foundational libraries.
Learn about new systems outside your initial region of expertise. (Ex: If you're an iOS engineer, learning about iOS dev tooling. If your a CI / dev tools engineer, learning about mobile software development, etc)
Basic Qualifications
iOS, Android, Developer Tools or CI/CD Software Engineering Experience
If you have iOS or Android software development, you will need have worked on an app that has been published to your respective app stores.
If you have CI/CD software engineering experience, you must have the ability to code and create CI/CD software systems, not just have ops experience.
Preferred Qualifications
Work experience on an architecture, foundations, platform, developer tools, developer experience, CI/CD, compliers, linters, release, build, IDE, code editor or other team of that type.

Uber,Sr. Software Engineer - Mobile Platform,"San Francisco, CA","Sr. Software Engineer - Mobile Platform, Uber, San Francisco, CA, Remote, Hide job, 8 connections work here, 1 week ago, 3 applicants","About The Team

We are open to Software Engineer II, Sr Software Engineer, and Staff Engineer levels.

Mobile Foundations and Developer Experience is a unique team that works on the foundational libraries, frameworks and dev tools that our ~600 mobile engineers use at Uber, and external companies via our open source libraries (Swift, Objective-C & Kotlin).

Our team has an unusually large amount of autonomy and a wide mandate compared to most teams in the industry, so there is always something interesting to work on. We are looking for highly passionate engineers or managers who care a lot about the practice of software development itself and who want to create a high amount of impact both within and outside of Uber.

Since we are an engineering infrastructure team, we are not really driven by product focused PMs telling us what to do. We look to our engineers to notice issues and think of solutions to such issues in our foundational libraries and things we can do to improve the developer experience at Uber. We are guided by what our engineers need, helped by various surveys and day to day interactions, but we still have to figure out the solutions to fulfill their needs. We work closely with other application platform teams as our main customers.

Major Goals of the Team
Fast build & iteration speeds for all Uber’s mobile engineers.
Remote development environments, somewhat similar to Gitpod.
Common frameworks and tooling to improve build speed, feature development speed and fun/developer morale, such as our Base UI mobile widget library.
Market mobile development at Uber via conferences, blog articles, twitter and open source software releases.
We also have sister teams with similar goals for other development platforms such as Web, Go and Java Backend.
How The Team Works
We are a US remote friendly team. If you live somewhere in the USA, we can hire you!
We don’t have a high meeting load, about 2 - 4 hrs/week for a typical engineer.
We are not a process heavy team, no weekly JIRA ticket scrums and story points for us!
Our on call is mostly a 9a-5pm support on call, you don’t have to worry about getting woken up in the middle of the night.
Our projects and our team is a marathon, not a sprint. We try to keep a sustainable working pace and hours to avoid burnout.
Our tech stack is fairly standard or usable at other companies, you will gain a lot of transferable skills if you work with us.
We are open source friendly. We’ve released multiple projects on github here at Uber in Swift, Objective-C & Kotlin.
In manager 1:1s we try to develop a mentor/coach type relationship and try to help you with your career or whatever else you want help developing on. We understand how promotion works and work to help you on that path if you are interested.
There is a ton of possible work to do and scope to take on, you are not limited by the scope of the team if you really care to work on ambitious projects! You will have a lot of influence on the future direction of the Uber mobile tech stack, which can reach out and influence the mobile industry as a whole as a result.
Uber is not a company that has strict siloing, engineers and teams can start and work on projects outside of the typical charter of their team, or work on projects that might be the charter of other teams.
The work you would do as a mobile platform developer is what I would call a ‘middle-end’ developer. Not a backend server developer, not a front end UI developer, but the person that works on the foundational parts of frontend apps. This means while you often are building mobile code, you often need to go beyond just the mobile stack and go into things like build systems and other software platforms and write things like networking libraries or UI toolkits.
Our Tech Stack

Uber’s mobile apps use a standard shared software architecture called RIBs, which is a simplified VIPER variant. We use ReactiveX streams heavily throughout our apps and all of our apps use a shared set of standard Uber libraries to do things like log uploading, networking or create Uber style widgets, called the Presidio library set. A large part of that library is our Base UI Mobile library (The mobile version is not public, only the web one, thus the link to the web one). We also use Dagger style dependency injection in our apps, using our own open source libraries called Motif & Needle.

We use Bazel as our build system and have a lot of custom IDE extensions and optimizations for our respective platforms. Our engineers still use their industry standard IDEs to develop code. We use Buildkite as our CI management system along with our home built SubmitQueue (slides) system. We use Phabricator for code review, but will be migrating to another platform in the future.
Android
Kotlin is the standard language to write new code.
We have a lot of Java code still in our Android codebase since adding Kotlin support is relatively new compared to iOS’s adoption of Swift.
Our minimum Android version is low, but we also use compatibility libraries to let you use the latest Android features.
We use RxJava + RxKotlin extensively in our apps, along with our Motif DI framework.
Jetpack Compose is fully supported in our apps and engineers can use it to make new UI screens now.
Most engineers use IntelliJ with Buck as the background build system, but we will have Android Studio support soon along with using Bazel.
Android engineers can spin up devpods, which are like gitpods, so they can do remote development with Jetbrains Projector / Gateway on large beefy rackmount machines.
iOS
Swift is our standard language.
We have some legacy Objective-C code but that isn’t modified much.

As a Full Stack Software Engineer, you will play an essential role in evolving Halp, making a large impact on our rapidly growing product. We seek out action-oriented individuals that aren’t afraid to voice their opinion and value healthy debate as much as collaboration.

What You’ll Do
Own code all the way through to production and verify it’s solving the right problem for the customer.
Ship well-tested, secure, reliable, and maintainable code within committed timelines that delights product users.
Be a great agile team member. Ship fast, small increments to iterate quickly towards building working software that solves real problems.
React to how our product is used in the wild, and help to fix bugs and production issues as they occur.
Understand the reasoning behind key product and design decisions and contribute good solutions to implementation and architecture discussions.
Support fellow engineers through peer code reviews and constructive discussions that concern architecture, data model, and feature implementation decisions.
Take initiative to drive new projects, reduce complexity, and unblock others.
Collaborate with cross-functional team members to influence product strategy and direction.
Lead key initiatives to improve a product that our customers seriously love. Seriously. See what Josh Senick, Senior Manager, Business Technology Operations, Slack, had to say about Halp: “The second I saw it, I said where do I sign?

Trend towards focusing on the customer problem and treating technology as a means to an end

Requirements
At least 3 years of experience in an engineering role at a software company

Ceros,DevSecOps Engineer,"New York, NY","DevSecOps Engineer, Ceros, New York, NY, Medical, 401(k), Hide job, 1 company alumnus works here, 1 month ago, 6 applicants","About Ceros

Join us as Ceros embarks on the next chapter in our mission to unlock creativity. Ceros is evolving into the essential design platform for professional creatives the world over. Our suite of cloud-based tools empower professional creators to push the boundaries of creativity, while our collaboration tools make it easy to get everyone involved in the process.

Today, our products power some of the most engaging experiences on the web. In 2021 alone, interactive content created with Ceros Studio — from landing pages and pitch decks to interactive social media — has been viewed more than half a billion times. In the meantime, more than 3 million comments have been added to digital content using Markup, our new visual collaboration tool.

Working at Ceros means having an impact at scale. Our products and services are leveraged by top tier brands such as Mashable, Bloomberg, Red Bull or Pinterest and are loved by more than 500,000 users. And we are building something even bigger and better: the creative operating system of the future.

We are backed up and well-funded by top-tier investors including Sumeru Equity Partners, Grotech Ventures, Greycroft, and Starvest Partners.

We are remote first forever with a 4½ day workweek that finishes every Friday at 1pm.

The Products

The Ceros Studio (https://ceros.com) is built in Javascript/Typescript on the frontend supported by multiple backends using PHP and NodeJS. The infrastructure uses Docker, Jenkins, and Cloudformation. We use a myriad of AWS offerings. We also use Okta for authentication and Fastly as a CDN. We've begun a migration to Terraform and are considering a migration from ECS to Kubernetes as we add services.

The DevOps team also supports Markup (https://markup.io), which is built in React and Typescript on the frontend and Typescript on the backend. Its infrastructure uses Terraform and Kubernetes on AWS.

The Team

As part of the Ceros product team, you'll be working with a cross-functional group of the most

talented people you've ever worked with. We hire only passionate and creative people with a

proven ability to execute, and every member of the team is equally responsible for moving the product forward.

We have a dynamic company culture that collaborates daily. We care deeply about the user

experience, and we debate passionately about our ideas. When you work at Ceros, you check

your ego at the door, and you aren't afraid to be honest, especially to yourself. We take our jobs

seriously but ourselves not so much.

The DevOps team is the primary caretaker of the infrastructure, responsible for owning the infrastructure roadmap and pushing it forward. We're constantly looking to improve the infrastructure to make it more stable, scalable, available, secure, more easily deployed, and easier to work with. We follow DevOps principles, which means we view ourselves as the deep knowledge and support for all the developers when they need to write infrastructure stories, helping to plan and review the infrastructure components of their stories.

The Role

As a DevSecOps Engineer, you'll sit on one of our two DevOps teams. Your primary objective will be to build out and improve the necessary security controls for our systems, while adhering to DevOps principles and best practices. You'll be called upon to aid in any investigative efforts related to potential or confirmed security breaches. You'll act as a technical resource for the security committee and meet with them regularly to discuss the progress on security initiatives. Our ideal candidate will be a well-seasoned DevOps engineer with plenty of experience and a strong desire in securing application infrastructure.

Key Responsibilities

Security Focused
Helping to identify, integrate, automate, monitor and improve security controls
Assessment of current and future systems to ensure they adhere to security standards
Investigation of potential security incidents to determine validity, impact and remediation
Providing technical evidence from our systems for auditing purposes (SOC 2 & ISO 27001)
Providing assistance with the completion of customer security and technical due diligence questionnaires
Participation in weekly security committee meetings to stay knowledgeable about the state of security across all of Ceros

General DevOps
Evaluating, testing, and building new infrastructure tools and technology
Writing detailed planning documents on stories so your teammates can assess the proposed approaches to a story, offer suggestions of approaches missed, and we can all agree on where to go from there
Writing maintainable code (probably goes without saying)
Carrying out and being on the receiving end of intense code review sessions from your peers who hold your work (and their own) to the highest of standards
Helping the feature development teams write infrastructure code, and reviewing said code
Writing clear documentation around infrastructure code and development tooling so that it's easy to understand, use, and modify
Working closely with the rest of the team to deploy new releases and data migrations without hiccups
Performing blameless post-mortems whenever there's an unplanned outage.
Supporting the development infrastructure so that feature teams and QA can collaborate on shared environments
And finally, ensuring the availability of the Ceros platform

Practical stuff we anticipate you having:
Experience with CI/CD pipelines, configuration management, infrastructure orchestration, containerization, linux administration... you know, DevOps.
In particular, experience with Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes, and AWS.
Experience implementing and automating application and network security controls including secure network configuration, server hardening and patching, static/dynamic analysis and vulnerability scanning, and threat monitoring
An eagerness to write well documented, clear code. You understand that infrastructure code is still code and the principles of documentation and organization that apply to every other kind of code, still apply here.
The wisdom of experience. You understand that principles and design patterns are important guidelines, but not hard and fast rules. You know when to apply a pattern and when not to, when to hold fast to a certain principle, and when to let it go. You understand that sometimes we can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good and we'll have to take on tech debt, but when we do, it should be with consideration and intention (and should be documented).
An eagerness to learn. We're looking for engineers who are able and eager to keep up with the pace of the rapidly evolving fields of both DevOps and Software Security.
A passion for software to be more secure. You understand the importance of the security of systems and ultimately customer's data, stopping at nothing to protect it all.

Key things to know
We want you to start ASAP
This is a full-time position
This is a remote first role but we are primarily in the U.S. Eastern time zone and prefer candidates who can have an overlapping work schedule with the rest of the team

Benefits
Competitive Salary

Uber,Sr. Software Engineer - Mobile Platform,"New York, NY","Sr. Software Engineer - Mobile Platform, Uber, New York, NY, Remote, Hide job, 8 connections work here, 1 week ago, 3 applicants","About The Team

We are open to Software Engineer II, Sr Software Engineer, and Staff Engineer levels.

Mobile Foundations and Developer Experience is a unique team that works on the foundational libraries, frameworks and dev tools that our ~600 mobile engineers use at Uber, and external companies via our open source libraries (Swift, Objective-C & Kotlin).

Our team has an unusually large amount of autonomy and a wide mandate compared to most teams in the industry, so there is always something interesting to work on. We are looking for highly passionate engineers or managers who care a lot about the practice of software development itself and who want to create a high amount of impact both within and outside of Uber.

Since we are an engineering infrastructure team, we are not really driven by product focused PMs telling us what to do. We look to our engineers to notice issues and think of solutions to such issues in our foundational libraries and things we can do to improve the developer experience at Uber. We are guided by what our engineers need, helped by various surveys and day to day interactions, but we still have to figure out the solutions to fulfill their needs. We work closely with other application platform teams as our main customers.

Major Goals of the Team
Fast build & iteration speeds for all Uber’s mobile engineers.
Remote development environments, somewhat similar to Gitpod.
Common frameworks and tooling to improve build speed, feature development speed and fun/developer morale, such as our Base UI mobile widget library.
Market mobile development at Uber via conferences, blog articles, twitter and open source software releases.
We also have sister teams with similar goals for other development platforms such as Web, Go and Java Backend.
How The Team Works
We are a US remote friendly team. If you live somewhere in the USA, we can hire you!
We don’t have a high meeting load, about 2 - 4 hrs/week for a typical engineer.
We are not a process heavy team, no weekly JIRA ticket scrums and story points for us!
Our on call is mostly a 9a-5pm support on call, you don’t have to worry about getting woken up in the middle of the night.
Our projects and our team is a marathon, not a sprint. We try to keep a sustainable working pace and hours to avoid burnout.
Our tech stack is fairly standard or usable at other companies, you will gain a lot of transferable skills if you work with us.
We are open source friendly. We’ve released multiple projects on github here at Uber in Swift, Objective-C & Kotlin.
In manager 1:1s we try to develop a mentor/coach type relationship and try to help you with your career or whatever else you want help developing on. We understand how promotion works and work to help you on that path if you are interested.
There is a ton of possible work to do and scope to take on, you are not limited by the scope of the team if you really care to work on ambitious projects! You will have a lot of influence on the future direction of the Uber mobile tech stack, which can reach out and influence the mobile industry as a whole as a result.
Uber is not a company that has strict siloing, engineers and teams can start and work on projects outside of the typical charter of their team, or work on projects that might be the charter of other teams.
The work you would do as a mobile platform developer is what I would call a ‘middle-end’ developer. Not a backend server developer, not a front end UI developer, but the person that works on the foundational parts of frontend apps. This means while you often are building mobile code, you often need to go beyond just the mobile stack and go into things like build systems and other software platforms and write things like networking libraries or UI toolkits.
Our Tech Stack

Uber’s mobile apps use a standard shared software architecture called RIBs, which is a simplified VIPER variant. We use ReactiveX streams heavily throughout our apps and all of our apps use a shared set of standard Uber libraries to do things like log uploading, networking or create Uber style widgets, called the Presidio library set. A large part of that library is our Base UI Mobile library (The mobile version is not public, only the web one, thus the link to the web one). We also use Dagger style dependency injection in our apps, using our own open source libraries called Motif & Needle.

We use Bazel as our build system and have a lot of custom IDE extensions and optimizations for our respective platforms. Our engineers still use their industry standard IDEs to develop code. We use Buildkite as our CI management system along with our home built SubmitQueue (slides) system. We use Phabricator for code review, but will be migrating to another platform in the future.
Android
Kotlin is the standard language to write new code.
We have a lot of Java code still in our Android codebase since adding Kotlin support is relatively new compared to iOS’s adoption of Swift.
Our minimum Android version is low, but we also use compatibility libraries to let you use the latest Android features.
We use RxJava + RxKotlin extensively in our apps, along with our Motif DI framework.
Jetpack Compose is fully supported in our apps and engineers can use it to make new UI screens now.
Most engineers use IntelliJ with Buck as the background build system, but we will have Android Studio support soon along with using Bazel.
Android engineers can spin up devpods, which are like gitpods, so they can do remote development with Jetbrains Projector / Gateway on large beefy rackmount machines.
iOS
Swift is our standard language.
We have some legacy Objective-C code but that isn’t modified much.
Our apps work with iOS 15 with an iOS 13 minimum deployment target.
We update our apps to the n+1 iOS version fairly quickly once they are public and stable. We then bump the minimum iOS version by n+1 too.
We use RxSwift extensively in our apps, along with our Needle DI framework.
We are prototyping SwiftUI and creating some pretty interesting libraries for it.
Most engineers use Xcode, we use Bazel as a background build system to further improve build times, but it’s fairly transparent to most engineers.
We are developing a vscode IDE called uCode so we can do a lot of cool things that wouldn’t be possible in Xcode and are investigating something like devpods for iOS.
What We Are Looking For From Engineering Candidates
The best kind of engineer on our team is a person who really cares about the practice of software development itself and has an interest in dev tools and foundational libraries.
We are looking for engineers who have experience with iOS or Android Mobile Software Development.
If you have this experience background, you will need to have worked on apps that have shipped to a respective app store.
AND / OR engineers who have experience with development tools or maintaining and extending a CI/CD system, which does not necessarily require mobile software development experience.
Dev tools / CI experience can be:
Build systems, such as xcbuild, gradle, bazel/buck/pants/blaze, etc.
Build farms, remote development environments.
IDEs, Text Editors, IDE/Editor extensions
CI: Jenkins, Buildkite, Github Actions or similar
Compilers, linters, static analysis tools, etc.
Git and other DVCS experience
Even though you might not come from the above backgrounds, if you are interested in dev tools and improving the practice of software development itself, then we will probably still be interested in you! Much of the dev tools we work with are fairly specialized, so we expect to train and onboard engineers onto that tooling anyway. Do you come from game dev, or really nerded out on things like rust as a hobby? Give us a shot anyway!
Our ideal candidate would be a mobile engineer with devtool experience and has worked in an iOS or Android dev tools team at a large tech company that ships large mobile applications, such as Airbnb, Twitter, Pinterest, Linkedin, Facebook, Apple, Google, etc.
What a Software Engineer Will Do On Our Team
Create new software or improve our existing software systems.
Write design documents and general documentation
Answer support questions about our team's products to other engineers in the company.
Work with other engineers to create or improve our dev tools and foundational libraries.
Learn about new systems outside your initial region of expertise. (Ex: If you're an iOS engineer, learning about iOS dev tooling. If your a CI / dev tools engineer, learning about mobile software development, etc)
Basic Qualifications
iOS, Android, Developer Tools or CI/CD Software Engineering Experience
If you have iOS or Android software development, you will need have worked on an app that has been published to your respective app stores.
If you have CI/CD software engineering experience, you must have the ability to code and create CI/CD software systems, not just have ops experience.
Preferred Qualifications
Work experience on an architecture, foundations, platform, developer tools, developer experience, CI/CD, compliers, linters, release, build, IDE, code editor or other team of that type.
Have worked at a medium or large company on the above type of team.",1 week ago

It can be hard to understand, difficult to manage, and unaccommodating to changes in our lives.

This is why we started Scratch. We wanted to reinvent the loan servicing industry, well—from scratch. We wanted to create a world where debt plays a healthier and less taxing role in more people's lives. By bringing world-class product and technical thinking to a multi-trillion industry that hasn't seen innovation in well over two decades, Scratch's platform empowers borrowers to have greater control, visibility and flexibility over their financial health, removing the traditional loan servicer from the equation altogether and bringing borrowers closer to their lenders.

Our team is rapidly growing and comes from diverse backgrounds including Dropbox, Pinterest, Prosper, Bloomberg and Ripple. Our office is based in San Francisco.

With a rapidly growing community of lenders and borrowers, we think it's time the world knows there's a better way to pay back their loans. We'd love for you to join in our mission and help play a role in changing the way we experience debt for the better!

Scratch’s backend and frontend presents many interesting challenges and opportunities for designing and architecting complex systems. Our APIs and user experience caters to both many personas: Enterprise (Lenders, Creditors), Consumers (Borrowers, Internal Operations). What's at stake? Scratch aims to be the source of truth for trillions of dollars. It's crucial that our novel platform ensures accuracy and precision on non-trivial math down to seven decimal places with zero data loss or security compromises, resiliency to handle a large number of loans at scale as well as the flexibility to handle new and innovative financial instruments.

About the role:
Architect core pieces of Scratch’s APIs and user experiences, optimizing for long-term maintainability, performance, and reliability.
You will work across multiple personas: lenders, creditors, borrowers and internal users.
Take full ownership and responsibility for building, shipping, and maintaining core Scratch APIs, end-to-end.

You may be a good fit if:
6+ years industry experience.
You have experience leading engineering projects.
You enjoy being a generalist working on both the frontend, backend, and anything it takes to solve problems and delight users both internally and externally.
You have a strong background in computer science.

We want you!

If you made it this far, chances are you’re as excited about working to change how people experience debt as we are—and we love that. Please apply even if you’re unsure about whether you meet every single requirement in this posting. Scratch is looking for smart, intellectually curious people who are invested in our mission, not just those who can “check all the boxes”.

Uber,Sr. Software Engineer - Mobile Platform,"Seattle, WA","Sr. Software Engineer - Mobile Platform, Uber, Seattle, WA, Remote, Hide job, Actively recruiting, 1 week ago, 0 applicants","About The Team

We are open to Software Engineer II, Sr Software Engineer, and Staff Engineer levels.

Mobile Foundations and Developer Experience is a unique team that works on the foundational libraries, frameworks and dev tools that our ~600 mobile engineers use at Uber, and external companies via our open source libraries (Swift, Objective-C & Kotlin).

Our team has an unusually large amount of autonomy and a wide mandate compared to most teams in the industry, so there is always something interesting to work on. We are looking for highly passionate engineers or managers who care a lot about the practice of software development itself and who want to create a high amount of impact both within and outside of Uber.

Since we are an engineering infrastructure team, we are not really driven by product focused PMs telling us what to do. We look to our engineers to notice issues and think of solutions to such issues in our foundational libraries and things we can do to improve the developer experience at Uber. We are guided by what our engineers need, helped by various surveys and day to day interactions, but we still have to figure out the solutions to fulfill their needs. We work closely with other application platform teams as our main customers.

Major Goals of the Team
Fast build & iteration speeds for all Uber’s mobile engineers.
Remote development environments, somewhat similar to Gitpod.
Common frameworks and tooling to improve build speed, feature development speed and fun/developer morale, such as our Base UI mobile widget library.
Market mobile development at Uber via conferences, blog articles, twitter and open source software releases.
We also have sister teams with similar goals for other development platforms such as Web, Go and Java Backend.
How The Team Works
We are a US remote friendly team. If you live somewhere in the USA, we can hire you!
We don’t have a high meeting load, about 2 - 4 hrs/week for a typical engineer.
We are not a process heavy team, no weekly JIRA ticket scrums and story points for us!
Our on call is mostly a 9a-5pm support on call, you don’t have to worry about getting woken up in the middle of the night.
Our projects and our team is a marathon, not a sprint. We try to keep a sustainable working pace and hours to avoid burnout.
Our tech stack is fairly standard or usable at other companies, you will gain a lot of transferable skills if you work with us.
We are open source friendly. We’ve released multiple projects on github here at Uber in Swift, Objective-C & Kotlin.
In manager 1:1s we try to develop a mentor/coach type relationship and try to help you with your career or whatever else you want help developing on. We understand how promotion works and work to help you on that path if you are interested.
There is a ton of possible work to do and scope to take on, you are not limited by the scope of the team if you really care to work on ambitious projects! You will have a lot of influence on the future direction of the Uber mobile tech stack, which can reach out and influence the mobile industry as a whole as a result.
Uber is not a company that has strict siloing, engineers and teams can start and work on projects outside of the typical charter of their team, or work on projects that might be the charter of other teams.
The work you would do as a mobile platform developer is what I would call a ‘middle-end’ developer. Not a backend server developer, not a front end UI developer, but the person that works on the foundational parts of frontend apps. This means while you often are building mobile code, you often need to go beyond just the mobile stack and go into things like build systems and other software platforms and write things like networking libraries or UI toolkits.
Our Tech Stack

Uber’s mobile apps use a standard shared software architecture called RIBs, which is a simplified VIPER variant. We use ReactiveX streams heavily throughout our apps and all of our apps use a shared set of standard Uber libraries to do things like log uploading, networking or create Uber style widgets, called the Presidio library set. A large part of that library is our Base UI Mobile library (The mobile version is not public, only the web one, thus the link to the web one). We also use Dagger style dependency injection in our apps, using our own open source libraries called Motif & Needle.

We use Bazel as our build system and have a lot of custom IDE extensions and optimizations for our respective platforms. Our engineers still use their industry standard IDEs to develop code. We use Buildkite as our CI management system along with our home built SubmitQueue (slides) system. We use Phabricator for code review, but will be migrating to another platform in the future.
Android
Kotlin is the standard language to write new code.
We have a lot of Java code still in our Android codebase since adding Kotlin support is relatively new compared to iOS’s adoption of Swift.
Our minimum Android version is low, but we also use compatibility libraries to let you use the latest Android features.
We use RxJava + RxKotlin extensively in our apps, along with our Motif DI framework.
Jetpack Compose is fully supported in our apps and engineers can use it to make new UI screens now.
Most engineers use IntelliJ with Buck as the background build system, but we will have Android Studio support soon along with using Bazel.
Android engineers can spin up devpods, which are like gitpods, so they can do remote development with Jetbrains Projector / Gateway on large beefy rackmount machines.
iOS
Swift is our standard language.
We have some legacy Objective-C code but that isn’t modified much.
Our apps work with iOS 15 with an iOS 13 minimum deployment target.
We update our apps to the n+1 iOS version fairly quickly once they are public and stable. We then bump the minimum iOS version by n+1 too.
We use RxSwift extensively in our apps, along with our Needle DI framework.
We are prototyping SwiftUI and creating some pretty interesting libraries for it.
Most engineers use Xcode, we use Bazel as a background build system to further improve build times, but it’s fairly transparent to most engineers.
We are developing a vscode IDE called uCode so we can do a lot of cool things that wouldn’t be possible in Xcode and are investigating something like devpods for iOS.
What We Are Looking For From Engineering Candidates
The best kind of engineer on our team is a person who really cares about the practice of software development itself and has an interest in dev tools and foundational libraries.
We are looking for engineers who have experience with iOS or Android Mobile Software Development.
If you have this experience background, you will need to have worked on apps that have shipped to a respective app store.
AND / OR engineers who have experience with development tools or maintaining and extending a CI/CD system, which does not necessarily require mobile software development experience.
Dev tools / CI experience can be:
Build systems, such as xcbuild, gradle, bazel/buck/pants/blaze, etc.
Build farms, remote development environments.
IDEs, Text Editors, IDE/Editor extensions
CI: Jenkins, Buildkite, Github Actions or similar
Compilers, linters, static analysis tools, etc.
Git and other DVCS experience
Even though you might not come from the above backgrounds, if you are interested in dev tools and improving the practice of software development itself, then we will probably still be interested in you! Much of the dev tools we work with are fairly specialized, so we expect to train and onboard engineers onto that tooling anyway. Do you come from game dev, or really nerded out on things like rust as a hobby? Give us a shot anyway!
Our ideal candidate would be a mobile engineer with devtool experience and has worked in an iOS or Android dev tools team at a large tech company that ships large mobile applications, such as Airbnb, Twitter, Pinterest, Linkedin, Facebook, Apple, Google, etc.
What a Software Engineer Will Do On Our Team
Create new software or improve our existing software systems.
Write design documents and general documentation
Answer support questions about our team's products to other engineers in the company.
Work with other engineers to create or improve our dev tools and foundational libraries.
Learn about new systems outside your initial region of expertise. (Ex: If you're an iOS engineer, learning about iOS dev tooling. If your a CI / dev tools engineer, learning about mobile software development, etc)
Basic Qualifications
iOS, Android, Developer Tools or CI/CD Software Engineering Experience
If you have iOS or Android software development, you will need have worked on an app that has been published to your respective app stores.
If you have CI/CD software engineering experience, you must have the ability to code and create CI/CD software systems, not just have ops experience.
Preferred Qualifications
Work experience on an architecture, foundations, platform, developer tools, developer experience, CI/CD, compliers, linters, release, build, IDE, code editor or other team of that type.
Have worked at a medium or large company on the above type of team.",1 week ago

Scratch's mission is to build a repayment platform to change the way consumers experience debt. Most of us take on debt to help us get ahead, or in many cases, to not fall behind. But for most of us—despite its necessity—once we have debt, it doesn't play a healthy role in our lives. It can be hard to understand, difficult to manage, and unaccommodating to changes in our lives.

This is why we started Scratch. We wanted to reinvent the loan servicing industry, well—from scratch. We wanted to create a world where debt plays a healthier and less taxing role in more people's lives. By bringing world-class product and technical thinking to a multi-trillion industry that hasn't seen innovation in well over two decades, Scratch's platform empowers borrowers to have greater control, visibility and flexibility over their financial health, removing the traditional loan servicer from the equation altogether and bringing borrowers closer to their lenders.

Our team is rapidly growing and comes from diverse backgrounds including Dropbox, Pinterest, Prosper, Bloomberg and Ripple. Our office is based in San Francisco.

With a rapidly growing community of lenders and borrowers, we think it's time the world knows there's a better way to pay back their loans. We'd love for you to join in our mission and help play a role in changing the way we experience debt for the better!

Scratch’s backend presents many interesting challenges and opportunities for designing and architecting complex systems. You and your team will work on high-stakes engineering challenges that will shape the future of loan servicing and debt. What's at stake? Scratch aims to be the source of truth for trillions of dollars. It's crucial that our novel platform ensures accuracy and precision on non-trivial math down to seven decimal places with zero data loss or security compromises, resiliency to handle a large number of loans at scale as well as the flexibility to handle new and innovative financial instruments.

About the role:

Architect and scale complex systems like our loan servicing engine and time-series database.
Design core pieces of Scratch’s infrastructure, optimizing for long-term maintainability, performance, and reliability.
Build and scale systems for monitoring, tracing, profiling, debugging, and deploying.
Take full ownership and responsibility for building, shipping, and maintaining core Scratch features, end-to-end.

You may be a good fit if:

6+ years industry experience You have experience in databases, distributed systems, and backend performance measurement and optimization.
You have experience leading engineering projects.
You derive joy from refactoring and abstracting in order to make complex systems fun to develop on and easy to understand.
You have a strong background in computer science and mathematics.

We want you!

If you made it this far, chances are you’re as excited about working to change how people experience debt as we are—and we love that. Please apply even if you’re unsure about whether you meet every single requirement in this posting. Scratch is looking for smart, intellectually curious people who are invested in our mission, not just those who can “check all the boxes”.

Benefits we Provide:

Health insurance: We cover 99% of your healthcare premiums and 70% of your dependent’s premiums and offer competitive medical, dental, and vision insurance plans.
Learning and development stipend: We offer a $1,500 per year stipend for your personal career development!

Ceros,Senior DevOps Engineer - Platform Team,"New York, NY","Senior DevOps Engineer - Platform Team, Ceros, New York, NY, Medical, 401(k), Hide job, 1 company alumnus works here, 1 month ago, 2 applicants","About Ceros

Join us as Ceros embarks on the next chapter in our mission to unlock creativity. Ceros is evolving into the essential design platform for professional creatives the world over. Our suite of cloud-based tools empower professional creators to push the boundaries of creativity, while our collaboration tools make it easy to get everyone involved in the process.

Today, our products power some of the most engaging experiences on the web. In 2021 alone, interactive content created with Ceros Studio — from landing pages and pitch decks to interactive social media — has been viewed more than half a billion times. In the meantime, more than 3 million comments have been added to digital content using Markup, our new visual collaboration tool.

Working at Ceros means having an impact at scale. Our products and services are leveraged by top tier brands such as Mashable, Bloomberg, Red Bull or Pinterest and are loved by more than 500,000 users. And we are building something even bigger and better: the creative operating system of the future.

We are backed up and well-funded by top-tier investors including Sumeru Equity Partners, Grotech Ventures, Greycroft, and Starvest Partners.

We are remote first forever with a 4½ day workweek that finishes every Friday at 1pm.

The Product

Ceros provides multiple products and the Devops team supports them all.

The core Ceros (https://ceros.com) product is composed of multiple single-page applications (Admin, Studio, and Player) written in Javascript using libraries like jQuery, Require, and Backbone. It is supported by a REST backend built in PHP. The Ceros Studio is built around the HTML5 Canvas element. We're in the midst of migrating both the frontend and backend to Typescript.

The infrastructure uses Docker, Jenkins, and Cloudformation. We use a myriad of AWS offerings. We also use Okta for authentication and Fastly as a CDN. We've begun a migration to Terraform and are considering a migration from ECS to Kubernetes as we add services.

The DevOps team also supports Markup (https://markup.io), which is built in React and Typescript on the frontend and Typescript on the backend. Its infrastructure uses Terraform and Kubernetes on AWS.

The Team

As part of the Ceros product team, you'll be working with a cross-functional group of the most talented people you've ever worked with. We hire only passionate and creative people with a proven ability to execute, and every member of the team is equally responsible for moving the product forward.

We have a dynamic company culture that collaborates daily. We care deeply about the user experience, and we debate passionately about our ideas. When you work at Ceros, you check your ego at the door, and you aren't afraid to be honest, especially to yourself. We take our jobs seriously but ourselves not so much.

The DevOps Platform team is responsible for the infrastructure and the design of our environments for each of our Applications. We are also responsible for the CI/CD, chatops, and the developer interface with our deployment tools and environments. We own the pipeline run times and therefore we are responsible for optimizing build times and run times.

We follow DevOps principles, which means we view ourselves as the deep knowledge and support for all the developers when they need to write infrastructure stories. We own the roadmap, but we don't stand in the way of product teams when they need to write infrastructure or pipeline code. We review their work and offer guidance and advice.

Key Responsibilities
Evaluating, testing, and building new infrastructure tools and technology
Writing detailed planning documents on stories so your teammates can assess the proposed approaches to a story, offer suggestions of approaches missed, and we can all agree on where to go from there
Writing maintainable code (probably goes without saying)
Carrying out and being on the receiving end of intense code review sessions from your peers who hold your work (and their own) to the highest of standards
Helping the feature development teams write infrastructure code, and reviewing said code
Writing clear documentation around infrastructure code and development tooling so that it's easy to understand, use, and modify
Working closely with the rest of the team to deploy new releases and data migrations without hiccups
Performing blameless post-mortems whenever there's an unplanned outage.
Supporting the development infrastructure so that feature teams and QA can collaborate on shared environments
And finally, ensuring the availability of the Ceros platform

Practical stuff we anticipate you having:
Experience with and knowledge of the following technologies:
Containers Ecosystem (Docker, Kubernetes, ECS)
Cloud infrastructure (AWS)
CI/CD pipelines
Infrastructure as code (Cloudformation, Terraform)
Linux Administration
Scripting Languages and Automation (Bash, Groovy, Python, Ansible)
In memory databases (Redis, ElasticSearch)
Relational Databases (MySQL, Aurora)
An eagerness to write well documented, clear code. You understand that infrastructure code is still code and the principles of documentation and organization that apply to every other kind of code, still apply here.
The wisdom of experience. You understand that principles and design patterns are important guidelines, but not hard and fast rules. You know when to apply a pattern and when not to, when to hold fast to a certain principle, and when to let it go. You understand that sometimes we can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good and we'll have to take on tech debt, but when we do, it should be with consideration and intention (and should be documented).
An eagerness to learn. We're looking for engineers who are able and eager to keep up with the pace of our rapidly evolving field.

Key things to know
This is a 100% remote role but we are primarily in the U.S. Eastern time zone and prefer candidates who can have an overlapping work schedule with the rest of the team.
We want you to start ASAP
This is a full-time position

Benefits
Competitive salary

401K match
Paid parental leave
Unlimited vacation days
Wellness Fridays (Half Day Fridays)
Excellent gear (Macbook Pro, external monitor, keyboard, etc.)
$500 stipend for home office set up

Virtual experiences in which Cerosians can collaborate, educate, and create social connections with one another

Scratch's mission is to build a repayment platform to change the way consumers experience debt. Most of us take on debt to help us get ahead, or in many cases, to not fall behind. But for most of us—despite its necessity—once we have debt, it doesn't play a healthy role in our lives. It can be hard to understand, difficult to manage, and unaccommodating to changes in our lives.

This is why we started Scratch. We wanted to reinvent the loan servicing industry, well—from scratch. We wanted to create a world where debt plays a healthier and less taxing role in more people's lives. By bringing world-class product and technical thinking to a multi-trillion industry that hasn't seen innovation in well over two decades, Scratch's platform empowers borrowers to have greater control, visibility and flexibility over their financial health, removing the traditional loan servicer from the equation altogether and bringing borrowers closer to their lenders.

Our team is rapidly growing and comes from diverse backgrounds including Dropbox, Pinterest, Prosper, Bloomberg and Ripple. Our office is based in San Francisco.

With a rapidly growing community of lenders and borrowers, we think it's time the world knows there's a better way to pay back their loans. We'd love for you to join in our mission and help play a role in changing the way we experience debt for the better!

Scratch’s backend and frontend presents many interesting challenges and opportunities for designing and architecting complex systems. Our APIs and user experience caters to both many personas: Enterprise (Lenders, Creditors), Consumers (Borrowers, Internal Operations). What's at stake? Scratch aims to be the source of truth for trillions of dollars. It's crucial that our novel platform ensures accuracy and precision on non-trivial math down to seven decimal places with zero data loss or security compromises, resiliency to handle a large number of loans at scale as well as the flexibility to handle new and innovative financial instruments.

About the role:

Architect core pieces of Scratch’s APIs and user experiences, optimizing for long-term maintainability, performance, and reliability.
You will work across multiple personas: lenders, creditors, borrowers and internal users.
Take full ownership and responsibility for building, shipping, and maintaining core Scratch APIs, end-to-end.

You may be a good fit if:

6+ years industry experience.
You have experience leading engineering projects.
You enjoy being a generalist working on both the frontend, backend, and anything it takes to solve problems and delight users both internally and externally.
You have a strong background in computer science.

We want you!

If you made it this far, chances are you’re as excited about working to change how people experience debt as we are—and we love that. Please apply even if you’re unsure about whether you meet every single requirement in this posting. Scratch is looking for smart, intellectually curious people who are invested in our mission, not just those who can “check all the boxes”.

Benefits we Provide:

Health insurance: We cover 99% of your healthcare premiums and 70% of your dependent’s premiums and offer competitive medical, dental, and vision insurance plans.
Learning and development stipend: We offer a $1,500 per year stipend for your personal career development!
Wellness benefit: We’re proud to provide employees a $100/month pre-tax credit towards any gym or fitness program.
Catered lunches and snacks: We have high-quality catered lunches every day and well-stocked kitchens.
Generous PTO (including your birthday!), sick leave, and parental leave
401k program: We offer a 401k program!
Additional benefits: We offer each employee the opportunity to enroll in pre-tax benefits, such as commuter benefits and an FSA account.",2 weeks ago

FranklinCovey,Software Engineer (Admin Platform),United States,"Software Engineer (Admin Platform), FranklinCovey, United States, Remote, Hide job, 2 alumni work here, 6 days ago, 2 applicants","Job Description
Title: Software Engineer (Admin Platform)
Reports to: Director, Digital Platforms
Location: Anywhere in the US, Canada, or Latin America

Job Summary
FranklinCovey is one of the world’s largest and most trusted leadership development companies, helping individuals and organizations realize their potential. As a Software Engineer on the Admin Platform team, you will partner with product and design to build an Admin Platform to help 1,700+ clients easily launch, manage and measure impact journeys. These impact journeys will reach, teach and transform the lives of 2,000,000+ working learners (you’ll impact 4x as many learners as all US business schools combined).

Role Context
Historically FC primarily offered in-person, event-based training. Over the last five years, we have made substantial investments, and have had significant success, transitioning the business to an online, subscription product (AAP). In April ‘21, FC acquired Strive, an edtech startup whose leadership development platform was used by leading tech companies like Slack, Airbnb, Pinterest and Intuit. We are now doubling down on our technology/product-centric approach and building out a significantly larger product and engineering team.

Why We Think This is a Great Opportunity
Interesting Product, Technical and Organizational Challenges – In the coming year we expect to increase usage on our Admin and Impact Platforms by 10x. This will require us to solve a number of interesting product, technical and organizational challenges.
Impact at Scale – FranklinCovey positively impacts the lives of millions of learners and tens of millions of their direct reports every year – FC directly teaches 4x as many learners as all US business schools combined! By building an Admin Platform that helps clients easily launch, manage and measure impact journeys, you’ll generate substantial impact at scale.
Startup Speed, Established Company Security – FranklinCovey's product & tech org is small relative to the company's learner/client scale, so you'll be able to move quickly to build a strategy and ship great products. Unlike a startup, FC is an established (and profitable!) publicly traded company, so you won't worry about the next funding round falling through and a lack of job security.

Essential Job Functions
Collaborate: You will partner with product, data and design to define the product features and functionality to ensure we're building the right thing at the right time and in the right way.
Build: You will ship regularly and iteratively, writing testable, readable and maintainable code.
Review & Architect: As a Senior Software Engineer you will play a leadership role in code reviews for the team, helping set the engineering bar, defining best practices, and weighing in on major architecture decisions.
Support: You will work with the sales, marketing, implementation and support teams to ensure users get the most value from the products you've built.

Job Requirements
3-10 years of experience building and shipping high-quality products (years of experience ≠ ability, this is a proxy but not a hard requirement)
Back-end experience with PHP and MySQL/PostgreSQL and front-end experience with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML is preferred but not required. We're looking for great engineers and are confident that you can learn the language with time and direction.
Drive to continually improve and share knowledge with your teammates.
Ability and experience mentoring/guiding/developing more junior engineers with code reviews, best practice sharing, and architecture decisions
Experience with performance, security, privacy, accessibility, and localization/globalization preferred but not required.
Experience architecting or refactoring systems of moderate complexity preferred but not required

Interviews and onboarding are conducted virtually, a part of being a distributed-first company.

Halp is looking for a talented Full Stack Software Engineer with a knack for solving problems and a passion for helping team members and customers. Our product and engineering team builds software that helps technical operations teams dramatically reduce ticket resolution time, increase user satisfaction, and amplify productivity. Every engineer at Halp touches all parts of our product lifecycle and has input into developing the future of our SaaS product suite.

As a Full Stack Software Engineer, you will play an essential role in evolving Halp, making a large impact on our rapidly growing product. We seek out action-oriented individuals that aren’t afraid to voice their opinion and value healthy debate as much as collaboration.

You will contribute to the core of Halp, surfacing intuitive experiences inside Slack and our web product to create and triage tickets that impact more than 100,000 employees at future-thinking companies like Slack, Pinterest, and GitHub.

As a product-driven company, our engineering team’s main goal is continuously building empathy with our customers’ core problems to better execute against our product strategy. You’ll own projects end-to-end and will architect, code, test, and ship web technology. You’ll also be involved in brainstorming, designing, and prototyping evolutions of the Halp product suite.

Own code all the way through to production and verify it’s solving the right problem for the customer.
Ship well-tested, secure, reliable, and maintainable code within committed timelines that delights product users.
Be a great agile team member. Ship fast, small increments to iterate quickly towards building working software that solves real problems.
React to how our product is used in the wild, and help to fix bugs and production issues as they occur.
Understand the reasoning behind key product and design decisions and contribute good solutions to implementation and architecture discussions.
Support fellow engineers through peer code reviews and constructive discussions that concern architecture, data model, and feature implementation decisions.
Take initiative to drive new projects, reduce complexity, and unblock others.
Collaborate with cross-functional team members to influence product strategy and direction.
Lead key initiatives to improve a product that our customers seriously love. Seriously. See what Josh Senick, Senior Manager, Business Technology Operations, Slack, had to say about Halp: “The second I saw it, I said where do I sign? How do we get this, because this is exactly what I want to do. This is the tool I’ve been wanting since my first day at Slack.""

Who You Are

A proactive communicator with great follow-through
Excited about learning from your coworkers and collaborating with people with diverse perspectives

Requirements
At least 5 years of experience in an engineering role at a software company

Knoetic cultural values

Written by our founder in 2020.

Intellectual curiosity: I want to surround myself with people who are endlessly curious, who are always asking questions, who are fascinated with understanding others and the world around them. We're the kids who grew up always asking ""Why?""

Intellectual humility: I want to work with people who embrace the scientific method, who go into conversations with an open mind and ear, who are looking for ways to sharpen their thinking, who are delighted to find out when they're wrong rather than invested in defending why they're right.

Relentless resourcefulness: Our company should be full of people who will run through walls to get to their goals, who will bring more solutions than problems to others, who will figure out a way to succeed no matter what.

Winning: People who thrive here will only settle for our company being #1. They can only live with themselves if we own the top spot. Second place is last place.

Positive impact on others: There are people, who by the very virtue of their presence, make everyone else around them a better person. It could be because they have unwaveringly high standards. Or are incredible givers that inspire generosity. Or are teachers of their peers. However they do it, they push others upwards. They are culture accretive; their very presence makes everyone else step up their game.

Speed: We're a team with a bias for action (paired with good judgment), a desire to get more done faster, because we know it's the only way we'll win.

Positivity: You know it when you see it - can-do, optimistic. That doesn't mean everyone doesn't have down moments - it just means on balance, you walk away from your interactions with them energized and charged up to do more with your life.

Continuous improvement: We're always making ourselves better. Stasis is the enemy… if you're not going forwards, you're going backwards. Everything is a work-in-progress in perpetuity - yourself included.

Note - even if you don't check every box in the job description, we still encourage you to apply!

Knoetic is committed to fostering an inclusive workplace, and does not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity, age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, protected veteran status, or any legally protected status.

Atlassian,"Senior Full Stack Software Engineer, Halp","Austin, TX","Senior Full Stack Software Engineer, Halp, Atlassian, Austin, TX, Hide job, 2 company alumni work here, 1 week ago, 1 applicant","Working at Atlassian

Atlassian can hire people in any country where we have a legal entity. Assuming you have eligible working rights and a sufficient time zone overlap with your team, you can choose to work remotely or return to an office as they reopen (unless it’s necessary for your role to be performed in the office). Interviews and onboarding are conducted virtually, a part of being a distributed-first company.

Halp is looking for a talented Full Stack Software Engineer with a knack for solving problems and a passion for helping team members and customers. Our product and engineering team builds software that helps technical operations teams dramatically reduce ticket resolution time, increase user satisfaction, and amplify productivity. Every engineer at Halp touches all parts of our product lifecycle and has input into developing the future of our SaaS product suite.

As a Full Stack Software Engineer, you will play an essential role in evolving Halp, making a large impact on our rapidly growing product. We seek out action-oriented individuals that aren’t afraid to voice their opinion and value healthy debate as much as collaboration.

You will contribute to the core of Halp, surfacing intuitive experiences inside Slack and our web product to create and triage tickets that impact more than 100,000 employees at future-thinking companies like Slack, Pinterest, and GitHub.

As a product-driven company, our engineering team’s main goal is continuously building empathy with our customers’ core problems to better execute against our product strategy. You’ll own projects end-to-end and will architect, code, test, and ship web technology. You’ll also be involved in brainstorming, designing, and prototyping evolutions of the Halp product suite.

What You’ll Do
Own code all the way through to production and verify it’s solving the right problem for the customer.
Ship well-tested, secure, reliable, and maintainable code within committed timelines that delights product users.
Be a great agile team member. Ship fast, small increments to iterate quickly towards building working software that solves real problems.
React to how our product is used in the wild, and help to fix bugs and production issues as they occur.
Understand the reasoning behind key product and design decisions and contribute good solutions to implementation and architecture discussions.
Support fellow engineers through peer code reviews and constructive discussions that concern architecture, data model, and feature implementation decisions.
Take initiative to drive new projects, reduce complexity, and unblock others.
Collaborate with cross-functional team members to influence product strategy and direction.
Lead key initiatives to improve a product that our customers seriously love. Seriously. See what Josh Senick, Senior Manager, Business Technology Operations, Slack, had to say about Halp: “The second I saw it, I said where do I sign? How do we get this, because this is exactly what I want to do. This is the tool I’ve been wanting since my first day at Slack.""

Who You Are
A results-oriented engineer who is comfortable with higher levels of ambiguity
A proactive communicator with great follow-through
Excited about learning from your coworkers and collaborating with people with diverse perspectives
Willing to voice your opinion but okay with not always being right
Trend towards focusing on the customer problem and treating technology as a means to an end

Requirements
At least 5 years of experience in an engineering role at a software company
An extensive background in front-end engineering and API design and implementation
Able to technically lead a product initiative from design to production
Able to guide scaling a platform across distributed services
Strong competency in all of the following: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, TypeScript, GraphQL, MongoDB

Nice To Have
Experience working with help desk or ticketing platforms

Our Perks & Benefits

To support you at work and play, our perks and benefits include ample time off, an annual education budget, paid volunteer days, and so much more.

Confidential,Founding Software Engineer,New York City Metropolitan Area,"Founding Software Engineer, Confidential, New York City Metropolitan Area, On-site, $120K/yr - $160K/yr, Medical, Vision, Dental, Hide job, Actively recruiting, 1 week ago, 1 applicant, Easy Apply","The company is building the future of car ownership with a D2C application that enables people to finally take back control of their finances. We are developing the first mobile app for car loan refinancing and a marketplace for trade-in of a car (think Kayak for instant car sale offers). People want ways to save every month and they often times don't know the best way to do this, which is where we come in.

Because each household will own nearly 19 cars during their lifetime, having a smart solution to manage the finances for these assets is critical. Unfortunately, that doesn't exist today. The tools and knowledge that people have today about car management is minimal and the $2T market is ripe for an overhaul. Problems with car often care create massive economic difficulties for people.

Our first product is helping people dramatically change the way they approach financing car repairs. The $380B+ market of auto service is ripe for an overhaul.

This is not your usual startup trying to solve Silicon Valley problems — we are focused on providing elegant solutions to the outdated and underserved auto market. Every car owner needs a far better solution to have a more positive experience.

What makes our approach different than others? Simple, we focus on bringing in the best people and supporting them to do their best work. That's it. In the technology space where most tools/infrastructure are easily accessible, it means that our edge is our people.
We’ve recently raised a pre-seed round from Crosslink Capital, a top tier investor behind companies like Chime, Casper, Pandora, and Postmates. Our leaders are seasoned veterans in scaling teams and we are ready to bring in the right people to build something amazing.

ABOUT the role

We're looking for an experienced full-stack engineer to help build the foundation of our product and early software team. This person will be a critical and influential team member, working directly with leadership to build an industry-changing solution unlike anything else on the market today.

Are you ready to redefine a category that impacts nearly every single person? We need a talented engineer to help build and architect how this gets done. On top of strong technical skills, we'll be looking for a great leader who is hungry to make an impact. You'll be responsible for everything car management - the main product's operation.

The Stack

It's early on so you will be responsible for some of the choices we make down the line (e.g. should we be adding Typescript? Great!). At the moment, our MVP is in:
ReactJS, Javascript, Python3
We run serverless and containers on AWS while accessing our serverless PostgreSQL.
We ship continuously - we test heavily with Jest, Cypress, and we deploy our site every time a pull request merges to master.

The Compensation

Equity - 0.5% - 1.5%
Cash - $120k - $160k
Healthcare - medical, dental, and vision policies.
Time off - flexible vacation policy to encourage people to get out and see the world.
Goodies - a new MacBook Pro and whatever hardware and software you need to get the job done.
Learning - learning and development opportunities for you to grow your skills and career (e.g. iOS courses in Udemy, O'Reilly books on React).
Seat at the table - come to work every day knowing your efforts will have a material impact in shaping the direction of the company.

ABOUT you

What makes the ideal candidate tick?

Passionate - Cares deeply about their work and its impact. Passion is energizing and infectious... when we want to motivate each other to do our best work, it starts with passion.
Independence - Understanding how to operate in ambiguity and bring projects from start to completion without technical hand holding.
Fearlessly Curious - Asking ""what if"" instead of ""what exists"" yields much more interesting products: Pinterest, Tumbler, Velcro.
Growth mindset - Being okay with not knowing something — we can learn, change, and adapt to new information. No one is perfect and as we build this company we all need to learn and grow together.
Humbly talented - We're not just looking for smart people. You bring everyone else up with you — you quickly realize when you’re wrong, and you do it without an ego.
Embrace failure - Knowing what doesn't work is just as important as what does. The quicker we learn what does and doesn't work, the quicker we build amazing products.

The Skills

You will spearhead the operations management software with the CTO and steer the product direction with the founding team. We encourage any candidate who meets 70% of these qualifications to still apply!
2-4+ years of Full-Stack software development experience - we judge by work not time (e.g. ReactJS, Node, Python, Java).
Experience with:
Web modern frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, etc).
Taking features + products from scratch to delivery.
Building end-to-end solutions that include front-end and back-end work.
Good fundamentals with proficiency in one or more languages such as Go, Java, C/C++, Python, or similar languages.
Excellent communication skills and ability to collaborate in a cross-functional environment with engineers and non-technical stakeholders.
Comfortable with Git, GitHub, the terminal, continuous deployment and integration, and other modern fundamentals of agile development.",1 week ago

We graduated from YC as part of the S20 batch.

Experience with industry standard build, test, deploy tools. At Zip, our stack includes Kubernetes, Spinnaker, Jenkins, Kibana, Prometheus, and Grafana.
Ability and interest to quickly learn new frameworks, architecture patterns, and programming languages as needed
Experience working at a small company with diverse responsibilities is a bonus, but not required.

We’re scaling fast at Zip (YC S2020)! Zip is tackling the $50B+TAM space to transform the way businesses manage spend. We started Zip because we saw the challenges companies had using outdated 20 year old software to manage hundreds of millions of dollars every year. We are a small but mighty team that helped scale category-defining companies like Airbnb, Facebook, Salesforce, Apple, Quora, Pinterest, and Square.

We graduated from YC as part of the S20 batch. We’ve raised $43 million in Series B funding – led by YC Continuity (Y Combinator) with participation from Tiger Global and CRV – bringing Zip’s valuation to $1.2 billion in 18 months. We’re growing quickly and need your help: we launched in early 2020 and are growing by 40+% every month. We’ve most recently been featured on YC Top Companies list!

Your Role

We’re growing quickly and need your help: we launched in early 2020 and are growing by 40+% every month. We have a wide product surface area, covering request management, no code workflow builders, customer-facing reporting dashboards, connections to ticketing systems, integrations with financial systems, B2B payment processing and more.

As a software engineer you will be responsible for building Zip’s core products and architecture. You will ship features that will be immediately used by our users, and will work with a tight-knit team that values open communication and cross-functional collaboration. We move quickly to solve a wide range of complex technical and product challenges. While we are an experienced team that can provide constant guidance and mentorship, we value engineers who can autonomously scope and solve difficult technical challenges.

You Will
Design and build highly reliable and resilient products and features.
Work closely with cross functional product and customer-facing teams to understand requirements and ship thoughtful solutions.
Write high-quality, extensible, and maintainable code.
Design and build scalable frontend applications and components.
Design and build APIs to drive existing and new features for a web-based application.

Qualifications
2+ years of software engineering experience.
BS or higher, in Computer Science or related technical field involving coding (e.g. physics or math)
Experience with web application and API development in production environments. At Zip, our stack includes Python, Javascript, React, and GraphQL.
Experience with industry standard build, test, deploy tools. At Zip, our stack includes Kubernetes, Spinnaker, Jenkins, Kibana, Prometheus, and Grafana.
Ability and interest to quickly learn new frameworks, architecture patterns, and programming languages as needed
Experience working at a small company with diverse responsibilities is a bonus, but not required.
Experience working with API connections with external systems like Jira, ServiceNow, Slack, etc is a bonus, but not required.

Perks & Benefits

At Zip, we’re committed to providing our employees with everything they need to do their best work.
📈 Start-up equity
🦷 Full health, vision & dental coverage
🍽️ Catered lunches & dinners for SF employees
🚍 Commuter benefit
🚠 Team building events & happy hours
🌴 Unlimited PTO
💻 Apple equipment plus home office budget
💸 401k plan

We're looking to hire Zippers and that means hiring people who take ownership, communicate openly, have an underdog mindset, and are excited to increase the pace of innovation for every business in the world. We encourage all candidates to apply even if your experience doesn't exactly match up to our job description. We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive workspace where everyone (regardless of age, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and more) feels like they belong. We look forward to hearing from you!",4 days ago

We’re scaling fast at Zip (YC S2020)! Zip is tackling the $50B+TAM space to transform the way businesses manage spend. We started Zip because we saw the challenges companies had using outdated 20 year old software to manage hundreds of millions of dollars every year. We are a small but mighty team that helped scale category-defining companies like Airbnb, Facebook, Salesforce, Apple, Quora, Pinterest, and Square.

We graduated from YC as part of the S20 batch. We’ve raised $43 million in Series B funding – led by YC Continuity (Y Combinator) with participation from Tiger Global and CRV – bringing Zip’s valuation to $1.2 billion in 18 months. We’re growing quickly and need your help: we launched in early 2020 and are growing by 40+% every month. We’ve most recently been featured on YC Top Companies list!

Your Role

As an intern software engineer, you will be shown how to build Zip’s core products and architecture. You will ship features that will be immediately used by our users within your first week, and will work with a tight-knit team that values open communication and cross-functional collaboration. We move quickly to solve a wide range of complex technical and product challenges. While we are an experienced team that can provide constant guidance and mentorship, we value engineers who can autonomously scope and solve difficult technical challenges.

Qualifications
BS in Computer Science or related technical field involving coding (e.g. physics or math)

We want you!

If you made it this far, chances are you’re as excited about working to change how people experience debt as we are—and we love that. Please apply even if you’re unsure about whether you meet every single requirement in this posting. Scratch is looking for smart, intellectually curious people who are invested in our mission, not just those who can “check all the boxes”.

About Scratch

Scratch's mission is to build a repayment platform to change the way consumers experience debt. Most of us take on debt to help us get ahead, or in many cases, to not fall behind. But for most of us—despite its necessity—once we have debt, it doesn't play a healthy role in our lives. It can be hard to understand, difficult to manage, and unaccommodating to changes in our lives.

This is why we started Scratch. We wanted to reinvent the loan servicing industry, well—from scratch. We wanted to create a world where debt plays a healthier and less taxing role in more people's lives. By bringing world-class product and technical thinking to a multi-trillion industry that hasn't seen innovation in well over two decades, Scratch's platform empowers borrowers to have greater control, visibility and flexibility over their financial health, removing the traditional loan servicer from the equation altogether and bringing borrowers closer to their lenders.

Our team is rapidly growing and comes from diverse backgrounds including Dropbox, Pinterest, Twitter and Google. Our office is based in San Francisco.

With a rapidly growing community of lenders and borrowers, we think it's time the world knows there's a better way to pay back their loans. We'd love for you to join in our mission and help play a role in changing the way we experience debt for the better!

Benefits We Provide

Health insurance: We cover 99% of your healthcare premiums and 70% of your dependent’s premiums and offer competitive medical, dental, and vision insurance plans.

Learning and development stipend: We offer a $1,500 per year stipend for your personal career development!

Wellness benefit: We’re proud to provide employees a $100/month pre-tax credit towards any gym or fitness program.

Catered lunches and snacks: We have high-quality catered lunches every day and well-stocked kitchens.

Generous PTO (including your birthday!), sick leave, and parental leave

401k program: We offer a 401k program!

HopSkipDrive,Marketing Data Analyst,United States,"Marketing Data Analyst, HopSkipDrive, United States, Remote, Hide job, 1 alum works here, 1 week ago","Who We Are

HopSkipDrive’s mission is to create opportunity for all through mobility. Our safe, innovative youth transportation solution is used by over 300 school districts, charter schools, government agencies and busy families to get kids where they need to go.

With nearly 500,000 yellow buses on the road every day and 3.5 billion miles driven a year, student transportation is the largest mass transit system in the US. And while districts spend $25 billion annually on transportation, only 30% of kids get to school everyday on a school bus. Add to the equation a crippling bus driver shortage and increasing needs for individualized transportation solutions, and it is clear the current system is expensive, inefficient and ripe for disruption.

We create personalized transportation solutions from one to many, and everything in between.

We’re a Company With Heart

Our partnerships with school districts, child welfare agencies and nonprofits ensure equitable educational access for our most vulnerable populations, including youth in foster care, youth experiencing homelessness, and youth with special needs.

We understand that the difference between struggle and success can sometimes be as simple as the ability to show up, which is why we’re on a mission to use innovative technology, coupled with operational expertise and new thinking to help kids reach their full potential by providing a safe, dependable way to get them where they are going.

We’re an awesome place to work

Our company culture has been well-recognized — HopSkipDrive has been named to Best Places to Work lists from Built in LA, Comparably, Inc. and the Los Angeles Business Journal. Comparably also named us to the Best Company for Professional Development, Best CEO and Best CEOs for Women lists.

We’re growing rapidly

Founded by three moms as a solution to their own transportation challenges, we now serve nine states and 16 markets across the country and continue to expand at a rapid pace, twice making the Inc. 5000 and Deloitte 500 Fast-Growing Technology lists. Backed by top-tier venture capital firms, HopSkipDrive has raised $70M in funding to date.

Who You Are

Reporting to the Director of Growth Marketing and Marketing Operations, the ideal candidate has a strong foundation in Marketing, a go-getter attitude, and the drive to advance their career in a rapidly growing technology company.

You are an A+ player who is inspired by the mission we are pursuing and by the opportunity to define a new category in an incredibly fast-moving market. You are excited to bring your best everyday, to learn from those around you and to push hard while contributing to our powerful vision of positively impacting kids’ lives everyday.

Roche,Principal Data Scientist,"Santa Clara, CA","Principal Data Scientist, Roche, Santa Clara, CA, Hide job, You have a preferred skill badge, 2 weeks ago","The Position

Impact Healthcare

Roche Diagnostics is developing and building a new business – Roche Information Solutions (RIS) - charged with creating an innovative portfolio of digital products that change the way patients are cared for by physicians and health care delivery systems. Our challenge is to bring together, integrate and analyze complex diagnostic, treatment, and outcomes data from medical devices, electronic patient records, as well as the data collected by our own software solutions.

By analyzing and using very diverse meta and patient level data sets ranging from clinical guidelines, paid claims, genomics, pathology imaging results, application user behavior data, etc., you will develop prototypes (both one-time analyses and in some cases functional proof-of-concept software) that transform selected data into action-oriented clinical or operational decision support information. All or parts of these prototypes may become part of a digital product that Roche delivers to providers and lab customers on a global scale as part of our standard digital offerings.

Make a Big Difference

As a Principal Data Scientist, you will leverage your data science skills, your proven track record of contributing to digital products and your experience with stakeholder management to identify, promote, and support the development of digital products functions and features from concept, development, delivery, and ultimate use at the point of care. This work will generate evidence to support the value of our digital products and also be used to improve them continually.

As part of the Data Services organization, you are a valued and collaborative contributor as you provide leadership as an articulate entrepreneur who advocates for the practical use of data science knowledge and techniques that drive delivery and differentiation of our digital products.

You will lead, conceptualize, plan and execute advanced analytics projects to discover key insights that contribute to our digital product portfolio, leading to high quality and more efficient patient care. Act as a matrix leader to identify data science contributors and ensure delivery. The data you will be working with is varied in type including -- but not limited to – clinical patient-level data, supplemented with data such as omics, imaging, digital health, etc. You will lead and collaborate with peers within your function and across the organization to develop and improve existing strategies, digital and workflow solutions, improve product support strategies, identify evidence gaps and data sources, design and execute studies, implement analyses to support improvement of existing products, and lead discovery and early development of new features or applications to drive our digital portfolio.

In this position, you will also ensure that the design, execution, and presentation of analytical results are adhering to industry standards and potentially improve and redefine current industry standards. In order to succeed, you will leverage and expand knowledge of available healthcare data sources and applicable state-of-the-art analytical methodologies, large scale data processing and visualization, and languages and tools (R, Python, SQL, etc.) both on-premise and in cloud environments.

In addition, you will rely on your scientific expertise, strategic organizational awareness, strong advanced analytical skills, and your ability to interact and influence cross-functional experts such as biostatisticians, epidemiologists, product owners, business, and clinicians, to discover novel insights demonstrating impact of various treatment decisions, and uncover key elements leading to best outcomes for patients.

Responsibilities:
Lead data services contribution to digital products to support product development - partner with product teams to assure that our digital software products benefit from the spectrum of data science technologies and its application to software development
Drive data science and analytical software development teams. Carry out analytics to support multiple product development projects and find solutions to new quantitative problems
Stay committed to offering innovation, find opportunities for new additions to our portfolio, enhance ways of working (including processes, methods, technology etc.) and share new techniques and lessons learned pro-actively with peers
Serve as an advocate to product, engineering, and business team members on what analytic features and functions are possible with current data assets and/or what has to occur to advance the use of data in the digital products
Mentor less experienced data scientists and act as an influential subject matter expert to your team members and the business you support
Leverage your strategic organizational awareness and systems mindset to implement sustainable, science-based practices
Maintain and expand knowledge and access to available and meaningful data sources within/outside Roche, and their application to digital product customer needs
Perform high quality, timely and accurate analyses using most relevant state-of-the-art methodologies, tools and resources
Be responsible for planning and timely delivery of assigned projects
Use and continue to foster strong working relationships with global colleagues/peers and customers and build a strong network in order to jointly explore new business opportunities, vendor relationships, data assets, analytical methodologies and toolsets
Build and maintain partnerships with other data scientists and analysts, biostatistics, medical and business leaders, and other key functional experts

Who You Are
Equipped with hands-on experience in data science and a passion to make a difference in healthcare and demonstrated past application of Data Sciences methods and technologies to deliver the highest quality digital products.
Data savvy, creative thinker and problem solver, eager to learn new techniques and expand your scientific expertise
Reliable team player, strong collaborator with good influential skills and able to establish yourself as a thought partner/leader
Excellent communication skills, effective stakeholder management ability, constructive at giving and receiving feedback
Strong solution finding, resiliency and a sense of ownership with effective prioritization skills, attention to detail and accuracy

How You’ll Have Impact

Corporate Responsibility

For Capgemini, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) brings together our impact on three pillars: diversity, digital inclusion, and environmental sustainability. In North America, our key priorities are partnering with our clients and engaging our talent across these pillars. We drive success through these efforts by utilizing networks of employees with a common goal to lead as architects of positive futures.

Employee Resource Groups

Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are voluntary, employee-led centers of excellence for development, retention, engagement, recruiting and knowledge sharing. Collectively, they bring different perspectives with a focus to foster diversity and inclusion across North America.

Each ERG has a dynamic leadership team which work to make a positive impact for its members and Capgemini as a whole. ERG objectives are aligned with a concept referred to as the 4C’s: Career, Community, Culture, and Client. Activities planned by each ERG must connect with one or more of the 4C’s to ensure maximum benefit to Capgemini employees and our business.

Currently 18% of employees are involved in one or more ERG. In 2020, they have contributed over 21,000 hours of engagement.

Environmental Sustainability

Our Commitment

Capgemini recognizes that even though we do not manufacture products, the services we provide and business activities in which we are engaged can still impact the environment. We are therefore working to minimize our environmental impacts as part of our overall North America Corporate Social Responsibility program. We focus particularly on our major areas of impact: business travel, energy usage, and waste management. We are committed to identifying and complying with all local and international legal and other relevant requirements relating to our environmental impacts in Canada and the United States.

Our Approach

North America’s environmental sustainability approach is based upon three core principles: resourcefulness, impactfulness and accountability. The program focuses on reducing energy use in our offices and data centers, reducing our business travel emissions and reducing waste. Our drive to improve our own efficiency also generates innovative thinking, delivering operational improvements as well as cost reductions.

Our Approach Has Three Core Elements

We are resourceful - driving efficiency and innovation in our key impact areas of travel, energy and waste.

We are impactful - enabling our clients, suppliers and people to reduce their environmental impact.

We are accountable - monitoring and reporting our impacts to ensure we meet our ambitious targets.

Corporate Responsibility

For Capgemini, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) brings together our impact on three pillars: diversity, digital inclusion, and environmental sustainability. In North America, our key priorities are partnering with our clients and engaging our talent across these pillars. We drive success through these efforts by utilizing networks of employees with a common goal to lead as architects of positive futures.

Employee Resource Groups

Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are voluntary, employee-led centers of excellence for development, retention, engagement, recruiting and knowledge sharing. Collectively, they bring different perspectives with a focus to foster diversity and inclusion across North America.

Each ERG has a dynamic leadership team which work to make a positive impact for its members and Capgemini as a whole. ERG objectives are aligned with a concept referred to as the 4C’s: Career, Community, Culture, and Client. Activities planned by each ERG must connect with one or more of the 4C’s to ensure maximum benefit to Capgemini employees and our business.

Currently 18% of employees are involved in one or more ERG. In 2020, they have contributed over 21,000 hours of engagement.

Environmental Sustainability

Our Commitment

Capgemini recognizes that even though we do not manufacture products, the services we provide and business activities in which we are engaged can still impact the environment. We are therefore working to minimize our environmental impacts as part of our overall North America Corporate Social Responsibility program. We focus particularly on our major areas of impact: business travel, energy usage, and waste management. We are committed to identifying and complying with all local and international legal and other relevant requirements relating to our environmental impacts in Canada and the United States.

Our Approach

North America’s environmental sustainability approach is based upon three core principles: resourcefulness, impactfulness and accountability. The program focuses on reducing energy use in our offices and data centers, reducing our business travel emissions and reducing waste. Our drive to improve our own efficiency also generates innovative thinking, delivering operational improvements as well as cost reductions.

Our Approach Has Three Core Elements

We are resourceful - driving efficiency and innovation in our key impact areas of travel, energy and waste.

We are impactful - enabling our clients, suppliers and people to reduce their environmental impact.

We are accountable - monitoring and reporting our impacts to ensure we meet our ambitious targets.

Waymo,"Data Scientist / Software Engineer, Planner","Mountain View, CA","Data Scientist / Software Engineer, Planner, Waymo, Mountain View, CA, $132K/yr - $184K/yr (LinkedIn est.), Hide job, 1 connection works here, 2 weeks ago","Waymo is an autonomous driving technology company with a mission to make it safe and easy for people and things to get where they’re going. Since our start as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, Waymo has been focused on building the World’s Most Experienced Driver in hopes of improving the world's access to mobility while saving thousands of lives now lost to traffic crashes. Our Waymo Driver powers Waymo One, our fully autonomous ride-hailing service, as well as Waymo Via, our trucking and local delivery service. To date, Waymo has driven over 20 million miles autonomously on public roads across 25 U.S. cities and conducted over 20 billion miles of simulation testing.

Software Engineering builds the brains of Waymo's fully autonomous driving technology. Our software allows the Waymo Driver to perceive the world around it, make the right decision for every situation, and deliver people safely to their destinations. We think deeply and solve complex technical challenges in areas like robotics, perception, decision-making and deep learning, while collaborating with hardware and systems engineers. If you’re a software engineer or researcher who’s curious and passionate about Level 4 autonomous driving, we'd like to meet you.

The Planner Evaluation team is working on one of the most challenging problems in autonomous driving: building algorithms to assess the safety and quality of our autonomous vehicles at scale. Evaluation at scale is of paramount importance in solving autonomous driving: the algorithms we build orient the development of planner software by defining the north star and thus enabling rapid iteration. Almost every improvement to Waymo’s planner is influenced by our work, indirectly (by providing the quality signals for onboard engineers to aim for) or directly (by incorporating our algorithms into our onboard motion planning code). This is no easy feat. As our self-driving car gets better and accumulates more miles, we need rigorous and intelligent methods to automatically assess whether a scene is risky, a maneuver causes discomfort, or an interaction with pedestrians or other drivers could be managed better. This can be done through geometric reasoning, simulation, machine learning, and/or modeling with statistical distributions. Developing evaluation algorithms in autonomous driving is an uncharted space and thus requires true ingenuity. If you are excited about leveraging a large volume of extremely rich data in an area with lots of unexplored territory to help the advent of autonomous driving technology, this is the place for you!

In This Hybrid Role, You Will
Develop signals to describe the quality of our self driving car's behavior, using a range of techniques including machine learning, statistics, math, and physics
Design creative uses of simulation to measure those signals
Work closely with statisticians, machine learning engineers, and roboticists to develop novel solutions to open problems
We'd Like You To Have
BS in Computer Science, Robotics, Statistics, Physics, Math or another quantitative area
3 years of industry experience
Python especially for modeling and/or statistical computing
Experience with tools for manipulating big data
Experience with machine learning or large scale statistical analysis
Problem-oriented mindset instead of only a solutions-oriented approach
It's Preferred If You Have
PhD in Computer Science, Robotics, Statistics, Physics, Math or another quantitative area
Comfort with writing production code in C++
Experience in robotics or with spatial data in another field

We are looking for an entrepreneurial, thoughtful, and relentless executor who is passionate about applied data analytics and machine learning (ML). We build products that abstract complex semantics of data, so that our users can make use of the power of analytics and ML with minimal cognitive overhead. This requires careful thought, high creativity, and a deep understanding of data analytics and ML at scale.

You will be responsible for identifying adequate application of data analytics and ML techniques into Unit21’s products, and take full ownership of the development lifecycle of the feature. This includes, but is not limited to, framing product’s goal as a machine learning problem, designing data acquisition strategy, implementing data collection pipelines, researching adequate modeling techniques, prototyping modeling techniques, and integrating the models into product.

You should consider yourself as a Software Engineer who designs a production grade software of data analytics and ML, and writes code for it, rather than a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer, whose primary responsibility is to develop analysis and models. In the beginning, emphasis will be more on adequate problem framing for the product, data acquisitions and analysis; nevertheless, we anticipate emphasis will shift to production software engineering as projects mature, so we expect your foresight into ML in production even at an early stage.

What we're looking for

Expected
Ideal candidate for this role has experience in developing analytics and ML powered features as a part of consumer or enterprise products, from design to implementation.
Proficiency in one of the large-scale data processing frameworks; such as Scala, Apache Beam, Hadoop or Dask, or working with data lake using SQL or other data query languages.
Proficiency in one of the ML modeling frameworks, such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Familiarity with modern ML modeling techniques, and experience to have implemented one as a part of products or business processes in an enterprise setting.
Experience with developing distributed systems in production settings for data analytics and ML features, such as distributed data processing pipelines, distributed model training, and model serving.
Bonus Points (Preferred Qualifications)
Post-graduate degree (MS+) in machine learning, statistics, mathematics or similarly quantitative discipline.
Self-directed, thrives in ambiguity and willing to collaborate with cross-team.
Experience of building ETL off of databases (such as RDBMS, distributed datastore) and data warehouses (such as Snowflake, BigQuery).
Willingness to continue researching academic papers for state-of-the-art ML modeling techniques, especially in deep representation learning for semi and unsupervised settings and related areas, or experience to have published one.
Familiarity with MLOps techniques, such as continuous data acquisition, continuous model re-training and monitoring, and experience to have applied it to production, would be a strong plus.

Founded in 2017 on the premise that “health is local” and based in Brooklyn, we are backed by Alphabet’s Sidewalk Labs along with some of the top healthcare investors in the country.

Our mission is to improve the health of underserved communities. Importantly, our solutions are designed specifically for Medicaid and lower-income Medicare beneficiaries, and we meet our members where they are, bringing care into the home and neighborhoods through our community-based care teams and Virtual Care offerings.

In close collaboration with community-based organizations, local providers, and leading health plans, we are reorganizing the health system to focus on what matters to our members. Equipped with world-class, custom care delivery technology, we deliver personalized primary care, behavioral health, and social services to deliver a radically better experience of care for every member and community we serve.

Over the next year, we’ll grow quickly to bring better care to many more members and their communities. To do this, we need people who, like us, believe that everyone should have good care for what matters to them, in their community.

Our work is grounded in a belief in the power of a diverse community. To close gaps in care and advance equity in the communities we serve, we have to start with making our own team diverse and inclusive. Our ways of working are characterized by creativity, collaboration, and mutual learning that comes from bringing together a community from diverse backgrounds and perspectives.

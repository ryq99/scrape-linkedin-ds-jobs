Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance

Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

Mentorship & Career Growth

DESCRIPTION

Our Amazon Kinesis team is looking for software engineers who thrive on creative problem solving and enjoy the challenge of operating mission critical, multi-tenant at massive scale. In this role, you will dive into problems to invent simple and elegant solutions. You will deliver cutting edge software and services that power Kinesis Streams and drive its availability and performance guarantees that all customers depend on.

To be successful in this role, you must care deeply about customer experience and focus on building performance that offers easy-to-use interfaces to customers. Never settling for status quo, you drive engineering best practices and constantly look for ways to make the things you own better. You have great communication skills and enjoy working in a fast-paced, collaborative team environment with diverse team members.

We’re looking for a new teammate who is enthusiastic, empathetic, curious, motivated, reliable, and able to work effectively with a diverse team of peers; someone who will help us amplify the positive & inclusive team culture we’ve been building.

About Us

Leading brands like Epic Games, Lyft, AirBnB, John Deere, and Vanguard use Amazon Kinesis Streams as their foundation for real-time streaming. With Amazon Kinesis, customers process Gigabytes per second of real-time user engagement for gaming and marketing analytics, build real-time IoT sensor analytics solutions, analyze millions of financial transactions in real time, perform network intrusion detection for security analytics, transform and load logs into lakes, and much more. These customers choose Kinesis because it is a fully-managed service that makes real-time streaming ingestion and processing reliable, easy, and at low cost. Tens of thousands of customers worldwide, ranging from large commercial enterprises, federal and state governments, regulated industries like healthcare and finance, to small start-ups have moved from batch to streaming with Amazon Kinesis Streams, and we are just getting started.

Work/Life Balance

Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. Most days, our entire team is co-located in the Seattle office, but we’re also flexible when people occasionally need to work from home. We generally keep core in-office hours from 10am to 4pm. About half of us come in earlier and the other half of us stay later.

On-Call Responsibility

This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every three months. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice.

Mentorship & Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new team members. Our team has a broad mix of experience levels and Amazon tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior engineers truly enjoy mentoring more junior engineers and engineers from non-traditional backgrounds through one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews.

We care about your career growth. We try to assign projects and tasks based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

Inclusive Team Culture

Our team is intentional about attracting, developing, and retaining amazing talent from diverse backgrounds. Yes we do get to build a really cool service, but we also think a big reason for that is the inclusive and welcoming culture we try to cultivate every day.

About Us

Leading brands like Epic Games, Lyft, AirBnB, John Deere, and Vanguard use Amazon Kinesis Streams as their foundation for real-time streaming. With Amazon Kinesis, customers process Gigabytes per second of real-time user engagement for gaming and marketing analytics, build real-time IoT sensor analytics solutions, analyze millions of financial transactions in real time, perform network intrusion detection for security analytics, transform and load logs into lakes, and much more. These customers choose Kinesis because it is a fully-managed service that makes real-time streaming ingestion and processing reliable, easy, and at low cost.

Scale AI,Software Engineer - eCommerce Product,"San Francisco, CA","Software Engineer - eCommerce Product, Scale AI, San Francisco, CA, $99K/yr - $175K/yr (LinkedIn est.), Hide job, Actively recruiting, 1 week ago","We recently launched Scale Catalog to provide AI-enabled data infrastructure for eCommerce. Scale Catalog is the fastest growing product in the company’s history.

In eCommerce, the most valuable data is catalog data, the selection of products and the richness of their associated metadata. However, maintaining and cleaning this high-quality catalog is a messy, difficult problem. A high-quality catalog means there are no duplicates (there aren’t two different pages each selling the same KIND bar or two records for the blue sweater and another for the red one), and each product is enriched with copious amounts of canonical metadata (category, style, material, color, brand, price, nutritional information, length, weight, ingredients, flavor, food category, health information, etc).

This catalog data is what underlies successful user purchases, on-time order fulfillment, and personalized recommendations. Similar to Scale’s beliefs about AI as a whole, we believe that starting with improving the underlying data quality is an extremely valuable offering to marketplaces, brands, stores, platforms, and really anyone selling something online.

Using Scale’s expertise in high-availability software, ML, and human annotation, we’ve developed a suite of composable APIs to stream enhanced product data to our customers. Ecommerce leaders like Instacart, Pinterest, and Faire use it to improve the conversion and engagement of their platforms.

In this role, you'll be given the opportunity to own critical parts of our product to meaningfully drive millions of dollars in revenue. You’ll work with talented engineers and operators across the US, Argentina, Europe, and Mexico. The ideal person is a natural entrepreneurial engineer who can take an ambiguous scope and lead the execution of outcomes, doing what it takes to hit them incl coding, talking to customers, defining requirements, etc.

You’re excited about solving customer problems, and you pick the technologies and tactics that balance speed, function, and long-term robustness.

The ideal person would do the following:
Own large new areas within our product
Build technologies ranging from frontend and backend to automated ML systems
Deliver experiments at a high velocity and level of quality to engage our customers
Work deeply with sales and marketing to increase customer engagement
Work across the entire product lifecycle from conceptualization through production
Be able, and willing, to multi-task and learn new technologies quickly
You have:
2+ years of full-time engineering experience, post-graduation
Experience at other API technology companies
Excitement to work with AI technologies
*Please note, this role is not open to new grads or interns at this time*
About Us:

At Scale, we believe that the transition from traditional software to AI is one of the most important shifts of our time. Our mission is to make that happen faster across every industry, and our team is transforming how machine learning can build innovative products. Our products provide access to human-powered data for hundreds of use cases and are used by industry leaders such as Open AI, Lyft, Meta, GM, Samsung, Airbnb, NVIDIA, and many more. We’ve recently raised $325 million in Series E funding at a valuation of $7B+ and are expanding our team to accelerate the development of AI applications.

We believe that everyone should be able to bring their whole selves to work, which is why we are proud to be an inclusive and equal opportunity workplace. We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability status, gender identity or Veteran status.

Mutiny,Lead Data Scientist,NAMER,"Lead Data Scientist, Mutiny, NAMER, Remote, Hide job, You have a preferred skill badge, 2 days ago","Growth is the top priority for every company. Yet the best tools and practices are restricted to a few elite companies who can hire hundreds of engineers and data scientists. Everybody else loses $19 out of every $20 on generic marketing. Mutiny is building a no-code platform that helps companies convert that waste into actual customers and revenue by personalizing experiences based on who is actually viewing. Our greatest differentiator comes from the machine learning models we’ve built that learn across our platform and help our customers make the content changes to convert their prospects.

This problem has not been solved in a decade and we are building an iconic company that will automate growth engineering for every company. That's why Sequoia, YCombinator, and CMOs of companies such as Snowflake and Airbnb invested. Mutiny is beloved by some of the fastest growing companies including Notion, Brex, Carta, Segment, Algolia and Qualtrics. We have quadrupled revenue year-over-year with even more on the horizon!

The role in a nutshell
The fastest growing companies employ dozens of data scientists to even have a chance at analyzing all the data marketing generates. Most have none. As the Data Science Lead at Mutiny, you will lead our data science efforts to build products that democratize access to these capabilities for everyone. You will turn our proprietary data set of successful experiments from the world’s top marketers into machine learning models that proactively offer recommendations around target audience, messaging, and other components to drive revenue for our customers. You’ll work with our engineering teams to deliver these insights in our product, and together we will build an industry-leading intelligent conversion platform.

What you’ll do at Mutiny:
Build models that guide customers towards the most impactful actions to drive conversion
Extract relevant characteristics from unstructured data about successful marketing content to automatically build insights that can be applied to all marketers
Build models to analyze audiences made of tens of millions of visitors to identify trends and anomalies and tell users how they can optimize the experience for that group
Fine-tune GPT-3 models that generate personalized website content based on the particular website visitor
Build the foundation of our machine learning research process and put in place the infrastructure to rapidly build intelligent features
Identify additional opportunities for machine learning in our growing feature set and data set
Build smart and delightful user-facing experiences

What you’ll get out of it:
You are joining a rocketship! We are backed by Sequoia Capital, Y Combinator and CMOs from some of today's fastest-growing tech companies including AngelList, Carta, Gong, Hopin, Salesforce, and Snowflake. We are growing incredibly fast and about to hit another inflection point. The potential is unreal. Join and you’ll see what we mean.
You will create a name for yourself by bringing innovative data science solutions never before seen in this category.
You will get exposure to real business problems every company faces (growth) that you can take with you to start your own company (or to help scale another).
You will have fun, plain and simple. There is a reason our first company value is that work should feel like play.
You will experience a new way of working. Our team is fully distributed across the US and EU. But we come together as a company for quarterly offsites (usually in super fun places). This combination of experience-based working is a competitive advantage we plan on leaning into.

What we’re looking for:
3+ years professional experience in Data Science managing projects spanning multiple modeling types/areas
Prior NLP experience within a user facing product (preferred, but not required)
Prior experience deploying and scaling models (preferred, but not required)
Someone who is energized by ambiguity and can create structure in a dynamic, fast-paced environment.
A kind human who wants to build an extraordinary product, culture and brand.

We are fully remote and offer H1-B Sponsorship.
Mutiny does not accept agency submitted candidates for this posting."

Render,Backend Engineer,Greater Bend Area,"Backend Engineer, Render, Greater Bend Area, Medical, Vision, Dental, +2 benefits, Hide job, 1 alum works here, 2 months ago, 7 applicants","When deploying applications in production, developers are forced to pick between two extremes: expensive yet simplistic platforms like Heroku, or complicated, do-it-all-yourself services like AWS. By contrast, Render makes it easy to get up and running quickly but also allows applications to scale and increase in complexity over time, preventing a transition to DIY infrastructure.

Our goal is to completely free up developers and teams from managing infrastructure. This will ultimately improve all software and enable entirely new kinds of applications.

We're building products that abstract over complexity and minimize cognitive overhead for our users. This requires careful thought, high creativity and a deep understanding of application requirements in production. Our stack is React, GraphQL, Go, Kubernetes and PostgreSQL, but we don't require prior experience with any of them. We're looking for engineers with high integrity, low ego, and an insatiable drive to learn.

Our platform serves over a billion requests every month, and we have tens of thousands of users including Stripe, NYU, and US presidential campaigns. We have product-market fit and rapidly increasing revenue, and we're backed by the same early stage investors behind Airbnb, Snap, and Stripe.

As a backend engineer at Render, you will take complete, end-to-end ownership of projects across the entire stack. You should already have experience building products across the stack and have a keen understanding of web frameworks, APIs, databases and multiple backend languages.

Engineering at Render

We're a small team of world-class engineers. We have complete, end-to-end ownership for every project we take on and expect the same from you. We review all major code changes through pull requests and are always pushing ourselves to do better. We iterate quickly and deploy to production several times a day.

Technical challenges

The biggest issues with platforms like Heroku are lack of flexibility, and cost. We are solving the cost problem by using containers and Kubernetes and intelligently scaling compute resources up and down. This will continue to be a major area of engineering investment for us going forward.

We solve lack of flexibility by using Kubernetes under the hood and abstracting all the associated complexity so our users get all the benefits (load balancing, service discovery, autoscaling, health checks, self-healing) without needing to manage Kubernetes or build everything on AWS.

The challenge is in building the right user-facing abstractions that make simple application deployments effortless and complex application deployments possible. User experience is our primary focus and drives everything we do.

Projects you might work on
We run our Kubernetes clusters on Google Cloud Platform and AWS. You will enable Render's clusters to run on other clouds and eventually in our own data-centers. You will also allow our users to connect Render resources with their private networks in existing public cloud infrastructure.
You will create an effortless serverless abstraction on Render and enable per-request billing for containerized resources.
You will build a managed MySQL product for Render users.
You will use machine learning to optimize container scheduling and save resources while keeping user workloads responsive.
Render works great with GitHub and GitLab repos. You will add Bitbucket integration.
You will build out Render's CLI and make the user dashboard even better.
You will create open source projects and documentation in multiple languages and frameworks to demo Render's features.

You are a great fit for this role if
You have a few years of professional experience shipping software. Bonus points if you’ve excelled at a small, high-growth startup.
You have an intuitive understanding of web frameworks, APIs, and databases, and have worked with multiple programming languages.
You are both curious by nature and an impressively quick learner.
You are unfazed by unfamiliar codebases and enjoy figuring things out on your own.
You can wear multiple hats and work across the stack, both collaboratively and independently.

The ideal candidate would check everything above, but you should certainly apply if you identify with most of it.

Why join us
We're solving a problem faced by every developer and development team. It's a massive and rapidly growing market (AWS is privately valued at over $200B, and there are over 20 million professional developers globally).
We serve over 1 billion requests every month, our users love us, and our revenue is growing quickly.
Our stock grants are in the 99th percentile.
Everyone wants to move their infrastructure to Kubernetes, but it's too complex for the average development team. Render makes it possible to get the power of Kubernetes without any of its complexity.
The former CTOs of VMware and Dropbox are two of our biggest investors and cheerleaders.
The company is led by Anurag Goel, who was employee #8 and Head of Risk at Stripe. He helped Stripe scale from 10 to over 400 people and is applying many of the same principles that helped Stripe succeed to Render.

Benefits we offer
Competitive cash and equity compensation with early exercise options and extended exercise windows.
4 weeks of paid vacation, available from day one.
12 weeks of fully paid parental leave for all parents to bond with a newly born, adopted, or fostered child. We will also work with you to create a supportive plan of return.
Long-term disability, life insurance, and 401K plans.
100% employer-paid medical coverage and 99% employer-paid dental and vision coverage for you and a dependent. FSAs available too.
Monthly wellness stipend.
Monthly mental health stipend.
Commuter benefits for Renders in the Bay Area, and home office stipends for remote Renders.
Continuous learning benefits & related support.

Working at Render

We value high integrity, low ego, an affinity for continuous learning, and the ability to figure things out quickly. We're always open to being wrong, and we love to improve our work through reasoned discussion and constant feedback. We trust and respect each other tremendously which makes doing all of this easy.

We'd love to hear from you!"

Oso,Developer Experience Engineer,Utica-Rome Area,"Developer Experience Engineer, Oso, Utica-Rome Area, Hide job, Your profile matches this job, 8 months ago","Old problem, new $25B+ market

Companies like AWS, Stripe, and Twilio have demonstrated that if a technology is not core to your value proposition, you should offload it. Still, every engineering team builds and rebuilds one piece: authorization, how you control who has access to what in your app. You’ve probably started with something quick 'n dirty – some IF statements and roles in a database...until you need to add more features, and more features. And inevitably you band-aid onto this system until you have to do a big refactor. Have you seen this before?

We're changing this picture and in doing so, we are creating the next $25B+ dollar market: the authorization market. We’re on a mission to create the global standard for authorization. Our vision is that in 10 years engineers will spend 1/10 the time and brainpower they spend on authorization today.

Why now?

This is a once-in-a-career opportunity to join a company at a stage late enough that the problem and solution are de-risked, but early enough that you can shape the product, company, and the market.

Why Oso?

We started with an open source product – adopted by thousands of developers at startups to the Fortune 100, like Wayfair, Intercom, Visa, Oxide, and Codecademy. Adoption is growing week over week, and we’re now launching Oso Cloud. We have met with hundreds of engineering teams over the last 2 years and know more about this problem than any team in the market. Oso is:
Backed by Bill Coughran at Sequoia, as well as the founders and CEOs of companies like MongoDB, Segment, LaunchDarkly, and Honeycomb
Founded by Graham Neray (early MongoDB employee – helped scale from $1M —> $250M revenue) and Sam Scott (PhD Cryptography)
Advised by Abhishek Parmar, co-creator of Google Zanzibar and Airbnb Himeji
Built by a team of user-first engineers, including multiple former startup founders and early employees

What you'll do
Show Oso to the world. Get the word out on Oso, inspire users and help them adopt it with demos and sample apps, blog posts, tutorials, and videos, plus talks at meetups, conferences and on podcasts.
Engage with our users. Engage with users through various channels (e.g., Slack) to help them with their problems. Capture feedback and feed it back into our roadmap, and convey our roadmap and progress back to the user community to close the loop.

Who you are
You're an owner. You are accountable to results over the process. You prioritize the team's success over the success of any one project.
You ship, listen, ship, listen. You're happy to explore product ideas through design, hacks and guides before building something fully baked. You have no problem throwing away ideas and code if they don't pan out. You get satisfaction from getting concrete output into users' hands.
You're for the makers. You want to understand our end users' world and prioritize solving their authorization problems above everything else, including your own personal preferences and the elegance of the solution.
You give and take feedback. You seek out critical feedback. You have the courage to give critical feedback to others.‍

Requirements
You have experience as a professional developer working in more than one programming language
You can create clear and creative technical writing, and you can demonstrate this by sharing long-form writing samples upon request.
You have worked at a startup or in a similar environment

Nice to have
Experience with our problem space, e.g., building authorization systems

DESCRIPTION

Do you want to work on a product that can do the following?:
Access petabytes of data in single-digit milliseconds
Replicate tables across continents
Stream terabytes of data updates per hour continuously
Back up hundreds of terabytes of data in seconds
Encrypt petabytes of data with no performance degradation
Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service that does all this and more. DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit-millisecond performance at any scale. DynamoDB can store petabytes of customer data and handle peaks of more than 20 million requests per second.

As a fast growing service at the core of the AWS Cloud, our business and engineering decisions have widespread impact across AWS, Amazon, and beyond. Many of the world's fastest growing businesses, such as Lyft, Airbnb, and Redfin, as well as enterprises, such as Samsung, Toyota, and Capital One, depend on the scale and performance of DynamoDB to support their mission-critical workloads.

DynamoDB is one of the largest distributed database systems in the world, and we continue to believe it is Day 1 for the DynamoDB business. We are constantly improving and adding new capabilities to DynamoDB, and we are looking for a deeply technical, team-first software development engineer to push DynamoDB even further.

DynamoDB engineers are constantly challenged to think of unique and innovative solutions. The quality bar is high. As an engineer here, you will work on the hardest engineering problems in distributed systems at a massive scale and on multiple dimensions. You will exercise your intellectual curiosity, work with motivated teams of sharp individuals, and get insightful guidance from senior and principal engineers.

This is a hands-on position in which you will own everything from end to end: requirements gathering, designs, design reviews, implementations, code reviews, incremental feature launches, operations, mentoring, and the driving of continuous improvement.

One interview with two team members, normally your technical manager and one of the founders. This takes about 90 minutes and is 50% talking about your experience and interests, and 50% programming in a collaborative editor.
That’s it. No day-long interviews, no multiple round odysseys. If we talk to you and at any point decide not to go forward, we’ll let you know rather than go dark.

DESCRIPTION

Want to shape the future of a NoSQL database service that supports mission-critical workloads operating at more than 20 million requests per second? Let's take its speed and efficiency to the next level!

Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit-millisecond performance at any scale. As a fast-growing service at the core of the AWS Cloud, our business and engineering decisions have widespread impact across AWS, Amazon, and beyond. Many of the world's fastest growing businesses such as Lyft, Airbnb, and Redfin, as well as enterprises such as Samsung, Toyota, and Capital One depend on the scale and performance of DynamoDB to support their workloads. On the DynamoDB team, you will see the impact your work has on the world.

As a senior software development engineer on the DynamoDB Storage team, you will be responsible for the architecture that provides the foundation for the entire service. The code you write will securely, durably, and efficiently store petabytes of customer data while allowing customers to consistently access it in milliseconds or less. You will help evolve the existing architecture into a next-generation, high-performance system that customers will use to access data even faster and operate at scale more efficiently.

DynamoDB engineers say DynamoDB is a technically challenging space that requires unique and innovative solutions. As a member of this team, you will solve the hardest challenges in distributed systems. You will sit at the unique crossroads where low-level storage systems and high-scale distributed systems intersect. The problems you face will engage you and stretch your intellectual curiosity as you track emerging industry trends in storage hardware and software systems. You will help lead an amazing team of intelligent individuals to deliver results that make our customers' experience even better. You will interact with other senior SDEs and principal engineers daily, and they will help you take your design and architectural skills to the next level.

Our systems must remain highly available, scalable, and efficient. We can't get away with two out of three. As a senior software development engineer, you will design systems that adhere to these tenets and mentor junior engineers to do the same. You will be a thoughtful steward of existing systems, appropriately challenging assumptions and rearchitecting systems when necessary to allow us to scale for growth.

If you want to test your limits and tackle technical challenges you won't find anywhere else, join our team!

Key job responsibilities
Identifying technical requirements based on business goals and product direction, and translating those requirements into detailed architecture and design.
Executing multi-engineer, cross-team projects, and mentoring others on project management and prioritization.
Delivering quality projects and features on time and on budget.
Leading design reviews for the engineering team. Setting and driving technical best practices for the team.

Performing data analysis to identify opportunities to optimize our services.
Maintaining current technical knowledge to support rapidly changing technology, and working with management and the development team to bring in new technologies when appropriate.

Reforge,Software Engineer,"New York, NY","Software Engineer, Reforge, New York, NY, Remote, Hide job, 2 alumni work here, 3 weeks ago","ABOUT THIS ROLE

Building a product is always about balance — between done and perfect, between taking on tech debt and taking your time, between what's needed and what's possible. In the lifecycle of a feature or even an industry, the right balance evolves.

At Reforge engineering, our situation is a little unique. Our customers are the leading practitioners in the tech world. Employees from Google, Github, Reddit, Airbnb, and more look to us to provide in-depth organized insights that accelerate their careers. Furthermore, they look to us to provide a product experience that reflects the high quality of our content. In the beginning, Reforge was a content-driven company, and we are evolving to become a product-driven company. We want to be the example of world-class education and community product.
It will be your job to think with us, to identify and build the best software we can in the moment with a grander vision in mind, and help us move the professional education industry to a place that reflects the reality of work. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be (sorry, couldn't help myself).

You'll be joining as part of the foundational team of a profitable proven startup. We bootstrapped to high seven-figure revenue, led by experienced entrepreneurs, and recently we raised a $20M round from A16Z. In addition, you will integrate into our community of subject matter experts, including the leaders who helped build companies like Slack, Pinterest, CreditKarma, ClassPass, ipsy, Eventbrite, SurveyMonkey, Thumbtack, and more.

ABOUT REFORGE

In a traditional world, before the advent of tech, bankers, manufacturing leaders, and others progressed to the top of their industry through an MBA. Tech followed suit for some time, with early tech company leaders heading into MBA programs at Stanford, MIT, and others. That's not true anymore. Tech has passed the MBA by and people are trying to figure out how to progress from mid career professional to the top of their field. Reforge is a new kind of educational company that helps you access the earned insights of the world's leading practitioners, learn and apply frameworks without leaving your job, and build a strong professional network. The path to the top of the tech profession is being solved here.

WHO YOU'LL WORK WITH

You'll be one of the early founding members of our cross-functional engineering team comprised of product design, software engineering, marketing, and analytics.
You'll work with our head of product, CTO, head of engineering, head of design, and your awesome peers in our engineering team to envision new solutions to customer problems based on our high-level strategy.
World-class practitioners - our programs are application only and very selective. They attract top performers from the world's leading tech companies. Your job will be to study their challenges and opportunities to create an amazing product experience.

WHAT YOU'LL OWN

Here are some delightful bullet points that outline some things you'll be doing:
Contribute to the Reforge offering by understanding the mission and chip in with feedback/ideas on how to improve Reforge
Manage one or more engineering teams
Work collaboratively with product thought leaders; help shape product strategy and ship impactful experiences for our members
Provide technical strategy and direction to your teams
Help engineers develop their long term careers, provide performance feedback, and conduct one-on-ones with your team to make sure they are thriving
Balance hands-on contribution and program management for products your team ships

WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR

Previous experience as a hands-on technical contributor
You have a user-oriented mindset and have built software with a proven track record of making it part of a successful business
Strong communication skills with engineers and non-technical colleagues, both written and verbal
Lead by example, build new leaders, and facilitate healthy progress throughout the company
You want to like the place at which you work

Our commitment to diversity and inclusion: We deeply value creating a team with different perspectives, educational backgrounds, and life experiences, and we prioritize diversity within our team. We encourage people from underrepresented backgrounds to apply."

So much of what we do at ReadMe is getting to know our customers… programmatically! We believe the best documentation is tailored to each individual user. But to do that, we need to know who each user is! You’d own all authentication and authorization across ReadMe—from our Enterprise offerings to getting our customer’s customers to their docs.

ReadMe offers several options for customers to customize auth for their users. Customers can integrate with external identity providers via OAuth, SAML, JWT, or webhooks, and manage project-level permissions for users via an admin dashboard. You’ll be maintaining and developing the UIs and APIs for these experiences.

Excited to improve code quality through tests, automation, code reviews, and best practices.
Able to collaborate across teams and mentor engineers on your team.
Fluent at modern JavaScript programming techniques for the back end and front end.

🌱 How you’ll grow in one month
Meet the team and be involved in planning meetings for upcoming features.
Get your local development environment running and work on small features and bugs.
Begin to refine the various auth experiences at ReadMe.

🪴 Within a few months, you’ll…
Create intuitive and secure UIs and APIs for our auth experiences.
Manage how we create permissions for users and admins.
Debug and streamline our current auth infrastructure.
Plan improvements and redesigns for auth and permissions.

🌳 Within your first year, you’ll…

Mutiny,Full Stack Software Engineer,NAMER,"Full Stack Software Engineer, Mutiny, NAMER, Remote, Hide job, You have a preferred skill badge, 3 weeks ago","Growth is the top priority for every company. Yet the best tools and practices are restricted to a few elite companies who can hire hundreds of engineers and data scientists. Everybody else loses $19 out of every $20 on generic marketing. Mutiny is building a no-code platform that helps companies convert that waste into actual customers and revenue by personalizing experiences based on who is actually viewing. Our greatest differentiator comes from the machine learning models we’ve built that learn across our platform and help our customers make the content changes to convert their prospects.

This problem has not been solved in a decade and we are building an iconic company that will automate growth engineering for every company. That's why Sequoia, YCombinator, and CMOs of companies such as Snowflake and Airbnb invested. Mutiny is beloved by some of the fastest growing companies including Notion, Brex, Carta, Segment, Algolia and Qualtrics. We have quadrupled revenue year-over-year with even more on the horizon!

Our culture:

We started Mutiny by first codifying what type of company and culture we wanted to build. These values define how we approach our work every single day:
Work should feel like play
Faster always wins
Stir the pot, regularly
Do the right thing when no one’s watching

Work closely with our product, design, and CX teams to define how features will work to drive the most value for customers. Be a critical voice in choosing the right architecture for our core systems, help to define an inclusive product culture, and learn from a world-class team of experienced engineers.

What you’ll do at Mutiny:
Architect, build, test, and ship highly-available and secure services that process and serve data at scale.
Use data to support product decisions and impact core business metrics with your work.

Familiarity with PostgreSQL or other relational database.
Advocate of automated testing. We always include a full suite of tests for a feature to verify and future proof our code.

Location: Anywhere in the USA, Canada or Latin America

FranklinCovey Summary
Franklin Covey Co. (NYSE: FC) is one of the world's largest leadership companies with 1,000 employees, 1,500 clients and 2,000,000+ learners. We help organizations achieve greatness on the four people-related challenges that matter most: leadership, individual effectiveness, culture and business processes. Our unique approach combines content, technology and people to generate collective behavior change at scale. Our core product, the FranklinCovey All Access Pass®, provides companies access to 20+ courses in multiple modalities and in >20 languages. The All Access Pass has grown from $0 to $100MM in recurring revenue in the last five years, making it among the fastest growing products in edtech.

Role Context
Historically FC primarily offered in-person, one-off training. Over the last five years we have made substantial investments, and have had significant success, transitioning the business to an online, subscription product (AAP). In April ‘21 FC acquired Strive, an edtech startup whose leadership development platform was used by leading tech cos like Slack, Airbnb, Pinterest and Intuit. Under the Strive's team direction and leadership, we are doubling down on the technology/product-centric approach and looking to build out a larger product and engineering team.

Role Summary
As a Software Engineer, you will build products to help organizations train their employees and overcome their most pressing people-related problems at scale. You will work with product, design, data, and content teams to build a modern learning platform, scaling usage (and impact) 10-100x in the next year.

Essential Job Functions
Ideate: Engineers participate early in the product development process. You will review regular quantitative and qualitative research about our clients and learners and weigh in on the product strategy and roadmap.
Collaborate: You will partner with product, data and design to define the product features and functionality to ensure we're building the right thing at the right time and in the right way.
Build: You will ship regularly and iteratively, writing testable, readable and maintainable code.
Support: You will work with the sales, marketing, implementation and support teams to ensure users get the most value from the products you've built.

Job Requirements
2-5 years of experience building and shipping high-quality products (years of experience ≠ ability, so we'll use this as a proxy but not a hard requirement).
Back-end experience with Node.js, Python (Django), or Ruby on Rails and front-end experience with React preferred but not required. We're looking for great engineers and are confident that you can learn the tech stack with time and direction.
Drive to continually improve and share knowledge with your teammates.
Experience with performance, security, privacy, accessibility, and localization/globalization preferred but not required.
Experience architecting or refactoring systems of moderate complexity preferred but not required.

Why We Think This is a Great Opportunity
Interesting Product, Technical and Organizational Challenges – This year we will increase the number of users on Strive's learning platform 100 to 1000x. This will require us to solve a number of interesting product, technical and organizational challenges – whatever your unique interest is, there's likely a good challenge for you to work on.
Impact at Scale – FranklinCovey positively impacts the lives of millions of learners and tens of millions of their direct reports every year – FC directly teaches 4x as many learners in the US as all US business schools combined! By building out platform integrations for learning and planning in the flow of work, you'll substantially increase the quality of the learning experience and thus improve the skills and experiences of that enormous audience.
Startup Speed, Established Company Security – FranklinCovey's product & tech org is small relative to the company's learner/client scale, so you'll be able to move quickly to build a strategy and ship great products. Unlike a startup, FC is an established (and profitable!) publicly traded company, so you won't worry about the next funding round falling through and a lack of job security.

Company Information
Franklin Covey Co. (NYSE: FC) is a global, public company, specializing in organizational performance improvement. We help organizations achieve results that require lasting changes in human behavior. Our world-class solutions enable greatness in individuals, teams and organizations and are accessible through the FranklinCovey All Access Pass® available in multiple modalities and in 21 languages.

DESCRIPTION

Want to shape the future of a NoSQL database service that supports mission-critical workloads operating at more than 20 million requests per second? Let's take its speed and efficiency to the next level!

Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit-millisecond performance at any scale. As a fast-growing service at the core of the AWS Cloud, our business and engineering decisions have widespread impact across AWS, Amazon, and beyond. Many of the world's fastest growing businesses such as Lyft, Airbnb, and Redfin, as well as enterprises such as Samsung, Toyota, and Capital One depend on the scale and performance of DynamoDB to support their workloads. On the DynamoDB team, you will see the impact your work has on the world.

As a senior software development engineer on the DynamoDB Storage team, you will be responsible for the architecture that provides the foundation for the entire service. The code you write will securely, durably, and efficiently store petabytes of customer data while allowing customers to consistently access it in milliseconds or less. You will help evolve the existing architecture into a next-generation, high-performance system that customers will use to access data even faster and operate at scale more efficiently.

DynamoDB engineers say DynamoDB is a technically challenging space that requires unique and innovative solutions. As a member of this team, you will solve the hardest challenges in distributed systems. You will sit at the unique crossroads where low-level storage systems and high-scale distributed systems intersect. The problems you face will engage you and stretch your intellectual curiosity as you track emerging industry trends in storage hardware and software systems. You will help lead an amazing team of intelligent individuals to deliver results that make our customers' experience even better. You will interact with other senior SDEs and principal engineers daily, and they will help you take your design and architectural skills to the next level.

Our systems must remain highly available, scalable, and efficient. We can't get away with two out of three. As a senior software development engineer, you will design systems that adhere to these tenets and mentor junior engineers to do the same. You will be a thoughtful steward of existing systems, appropriately challenging assumptions and rearchitecting systems when necessary to allow us to scale for growth.

If you want to test your limits and tackle technical challenges you won't find anywhere else, join our team!

Key job responsibilities
Identifying technical requirements based on business goals and product direction, and translating those requirements into detailed architecture and design.
Executing multi-engineer, cross-team projects, and mentoring others on project management and prioritization.
Delivering quality projects and features on time and on budget.
Leading design reviews for the engineering team. Setting and driving technical best practices for the team.

Performing data analysis to identify opportunities to optimize our services.
Maintaining current technical knowledge to support rapidly changing technology, and working with management and the development team to bring in new technologies when appropriate.

What you should know about us
We are a small, dedicated team and we keep close to our customers. We get our features and fixes into the hands of customers quickly and likewise get feedback quickly.
We've been around for 13 years, and are completely self-funded and profitable which allows us to build the products we wish existed.
We involve the entire team in the future of the company. Everyone's feedback is used to chart the product and company's course.

Hiring Process
You submit your resume / CV / portfolio, etc. So nice to meet you! Please include small, self-contained code sample or a link to where one can be found. It can be in any language of your choice; we are more interested in clarity than complexity. A small program you've written or something else you are proud of would be ideal.
We’ll schedule a 15-30 minute phone screen. It’s a get-to-know-you (and us) sort of thing, with a few technical screening questions. We don’t expect you to program over the phone, though, so don’t worry. Feel free to ask us any questions here.
Take-home project. We have a project for you to work on at your leisure. We suggest you allocate an hour or two to it.
One interview with two team members, normally your technical manager and one of the founders. This takes about 90 minutes and is 50% talking about your experience and interests, and 50% programming in a collaborative editor.
That’s it. No day-long interviews, no multiple round odysseys. If we talk to you and at any point decide not to go forward, we’ll let you know rather than go dark."

Why Ergatta?

Ergatta is changing the motivation that moves people. We are a team of bright, driven, and innovative thinkers on a mission to build a new consumer category: game-based home fitness. Our flagship product, the Ergatta Rower, provides a competitive and personalized full-body rowing workout through an engaging game-based interface. Our products are sustainably-made in New England from American cherrywood and designed to be on display.

As fitness activity increasingly shifts into the home, we believe the big winners will be those who innovate around what is on the screen. Our content provides a new and uniquely addictive consumer experience, radically different from traditional instructor-led offerings.

Ergatta recently closed a $30M Series A, led by Advanced Venture Partners and joined by Greycroft, Fifth Wall, Gaingels, and Hans Tung (GCV). Off the heels of that capital raise, we are expanding our game studio, breaking into new verticals, and continuing to challenge the way at-home fitness “should” look and feel.

However, above all else, we are investing in our company’s most important asset: our people.

Three Reasons to Join Ergatta:
Build something new - Rollerblade invented inline skating. Airbnb created home-sharing. Being a part of Ergatta is a chance to define a new frontier for fitness.
Be on the founding team - We are a small but mighty team. As a part of the first 75 founding team, you have an opportunity to shape the future of the company and product experience.
Define & accelerate your career - This is a place full of brilliant category experts to learn from, resources to take your career to the next level, and space to chart your own path.

Benefits and Perks:

Ergatta offers competitive salaries, stock options, health insurance with 100% premium covered, a 401(k) plan, in addition to:
Unlimited vacation & paid holidays - our philosophy is that life is all about balance, and we encourage our employees to take time off to recharge when they need it. We observe 12 paid holidays as a company, to unplug and celebrate with friends and family!
Paid Parental Leave - we want our employees to take time off and have a smooth, worry-free transition back to work when they’re welcoming a new member to the family!
Flexible work hours and WFH policy - the traditional workplace is evolving and we’re listening. We operate on a hybrid model, with some of our employees working fully remotely. Our NYC-based staff comes into the office twice a week and we offer WFH stipends to all full-time employees so they can be productive wherever they are working from.
Free Rower - we consider this an investment in your mental and physical wellbeing. Every Ergatta employee gets a free rower, and fully covered membership.
Weekly happy hours & regular company gatherings - simply put, we love spending time together! Ergatta employees know how to have fun (we even have an illustrious “Party Planning Committee!”) and we get together as a group - both in person and virtually - whenever possible.

Ergatta champions diversity and is an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, age, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, veteran or disability status.

We look forward to meeting you,

Yet the best tools and practices are restricted to a few elite companies who can hire hundreds of engineers and data scientists. Everybody else loses $19 out of every $20 on generic marketing. Mutiny is building a no-code platform that helps companies convert that waste into actual customers and revenue by personalizing experiences based on who is actually viewing. Our greatest differentiator comes from the machine learning models we’ve built that learn across our platform and help our customers make the content changes to convert their prospects.

This problem has not been solved in a decade and we are building an iconic company that will automate growth engineering for every company. That's why Sequoia, YCombinator, and CMOs of companies such as Snowflake and Airbnb invested. Mutiny is beloved by some of the fastest growing companies including Notion, Brex, Carta, Segment, Algolia and Qualtrics. We have quadrupled revenue year-over-year with even more on the horizon!

Our culture:

Work closely with our product, design, and CX teams to define how features will work to drive the most value for customers. Be a critical voice in choosing the right architecture for our core systems, help to define an inclusive product culture, and learn from a world-class team of experienced engineers.

What you’ll do at Mutiny:
Architect, build, test, and ship highly-available and secure services that process and serve data at scale.
Use data to support product decisions and impact core business metrics with your work.
Use the latest web technologies and tools. Currently, we have services in Ruby and TypeScript and invest in our tooling and automation to remain productive.
Work with the most advanced machine learning services, like Open AI's GPT-3, to automatically generate optimized content for customers.
Build great user experiences that allow customers to easily understand their web audience and create personalized experiences for their key segments.

What we are looking for:
6+ years of software engineering experience in a web development or infrastructure position.
Fluency in a backend programming language of choice (e.g. Python, Ruby, Node, Scala, etc).
Fluency in a frontend programming language of choice (e.g. React, Javascript, Typescript).
Familiarity with PostgreSQL or other relational database.
Advocate of automated testing. We always include a full suite of tests for a feature to verify and future proof our code.
An exceptionally high performance bar for oneself and everyone on the team. Unafraid to communicate what’s working and what needs to change.

In eCommerce, the most valuable data is catalog data, the selection of products and the richness of their associated metadata. However, maintaining and cleaning this high-quality catalog is a messy, difficult problem. A high-quality catalog means there are no duplicates (there aren’t two different pages each selling the same KIND bar or two records for the blue sweater and another for the red one), and each product is enriched with copious amounts of canonical metadata (category, style, material, color, brand, price, nutritional information, length, weight, ingredients, flavor, food category, health information, etc).

Using Scale’s expertise in high-availability software, ML, and human annotation, we’ve developed a suite of composable APIs to stream enhanced product data to our customers. Ecommerce leaders like Instacart, Pinterest, and Faire use it to improve the conversion and engagement of their platforms.

Wisetack,Principal Software Engineer,United States,"Principal Software Engineer, Wisetack, United States, Remote, Medical, Vision, Dental, 401(k), Hide job, 1 day ago, 6 applicants","Company Overview

At Wisetack, we’re building financially-responsible consumer lending products that help service-based businesses thrive.

Wisetack is a well-funded :100 person startup founded in 2018 by a team of experienced fintech veterans, with a leadership team that comes from PayPal, LinkedIn, Lending Club, Affirm, Amazon, and other top companies. We’re backed by leading VCs, including Insight Partners, Greylock, and Bain Capital Ventures, (investors in Airbnb, LinkedIn, Instagram, Dropbox, and many more.)

We raised a $45M Series B last year and since then, we've invested in the team and the product and signed a slew of new partnerships. This is a fun stage in any company's lifecycle where we've got the core foundation built, a healthy growth rate, and a clear path to success, but you'd still be joining early enough to help shape the future of the company.

Business Insider called us one of the 70 most promising startups changing the world of finance , LendIt selected us as this year's winner in the Best Emerging Lending Platform category for their Fintech Industry Awards, and we were just named to the inaugural SMBTech 50 list (perhaps you saw us on the billboard in Times Square?) The external recognition is great, but we're equally -- if not more -- happy with the recognition from our customers. Our current NPS rating is a sky-high 78. We're proud that we're building a product that customers love and we believe that this is the most important foundation of a great company.

Our Engineering team principles

Everyone is an engineer.No matter what their title is, everyone contributes to the code. Everyone delivers.

Initiative and ownership. We want every team member to lead the work they do. Design the best solutions and implement them. Ask for help from others when you need it.

One team.We are low ego and support each other.

Learning and growth. We believe growth is a huge motivator. We want everyone on the team to have an opportunity to learn and grow in their career. If you are smart and want to learn, you should be with us even if you don't have all the skills we need at the moment.

Check out this post from our blog where we go into more detail about these principles.

The job

Wisetack is looking for a Principal Software Engineer to be an early foundational member of the technical team. You will be a leader within your team, not as management, but as a force multiplier who sets examples of good code and who helps their teammates contribute to their full potential.

Responsibilities
Write good code. You will implement new features, troubleshoot and fix bugs, and set an example for your teammates in how you do so.
Keep in mind a bigger picture than just your own work. Always look for ways to improve our code and our process, thinking about not just what we need now, but what we will need next month and next year.
Take ownership. You will keep an eye out for tech debt, buggy edge cases, and other pain points; bring them to the attention of your team, and help establish and prioritize a path to reducing or eliminating them.
Work efficiently and improve efficiency. We select good tools, integrate them, and build automation to expedite our own work and get better quality at lower cost. You will need to think and work this way too.
Collaborate and communicate. You will review code and documentation produced by other engineers, suggesting changes to increase the quality of their contributions. You will help establish and document best practices. You will seek out feedback from your peers, to increase the quality of your own contributions. You will be an active participant in our Scrum process: refining, planning, standups, and demos.
And, most importantly, care about the business and move it forward. We will win together. The company is very transparent, so you will be engaged and connected to our business goals.

Skills For Success
Understanding of web applications and RESTful APIs, from the backend and/or frontend perspective
Java, React, and/or AWS (DynamoDB, Lambda, SNS/SQS, etc) – you don’t need to be an expert in all 3 of these, but an ideal candidate will at least have strong experience with 2 of them
Learning and problem solving
Communication, collaboration, analysis, and architecture
Fintech experience is a plus

Why you should consider Wisetack
We deliver a product that helps entrepreneurs bring their dreams to life - build small businesses that flourish!
Huge market and fantastic investors.
Innovative and fun leadership team with a lot of relevant experience and credibility.
Technology-driven product and organization.
Skillful engineering team committed to innovation, learning, efficiency, and quality.
Modern cloud and data technologies.
Flexibility to work remotely most of the time.
We’re a Great Place to Work-Certified company!

SF Bay Area candidates can choose to work from our San Francisco office (whenever we return to an office) or from home most days. If remote, you should be able to come to San Francisco 4-6 times per year.

Benefits

We offer competitive salary and equity packages, as well as medical, dental, and vision insurance, a Learning & Development stipend, a 401k plan, and a growing number of other standard and not-so-standard benefits.

More than that, though, we offer a career-defining opportunity for the right candidate. Spend a little time on our About Us page , researching our team and our values, and check out our Press page and our blog for more background on who we are and what we do. If you think this might be a fit, we’d love to hear from you!

Our Remote Policy

For now and the near-term future, we are fully remote. We may have some sort of office setup within the next year, and that office will be located in San Francisco. When we do, SF-based employees will have the option to work from an office, if they so choose. That said, most roles at the company, including this one, can be fully remote within the US, and some contractor roles may be available outside the US. Our workforce is currently spread across 15 different US states, and 4 different countries.

Yes, we're still hiring!

We know that some tech companies face a difficult situation and have announced layoffs in response to changes in the venture funding market as well as broader economic pressures. Not Wisetack! Our business is doing incredibly well and growing at a fast pace. We also have plenty of capital, allowing us to continue adding key members to our team while remaining very prudent with our spending, as we always have."

Sundae,Senior Backend Software Engineer,United States,"Senior Backend Software Engineer, Sundae, United States, Remote, Medical, +1 benefit, Hide job, Actively recruiting, 4 days ago, 3 applicants","About Sundae

Sundae’s mission is to help homeowners get the best outcome when it’s time to sell a house that needs some love. For too long, the process of selling outdated and damaged houses has been terrible for sellers. Local property investors capitalize on homeowner distress to purchase houses cheaply and resell them for huge profits.

Sundae is putting more of those profits back in the hands of the homeowner. We’ve developed a model to predict when sellers will need our help, and a best-in-class sales and marketing team to reach them and a trusted brand that allows us to grow even faster through word of mouth and referrals. With scale and efficiency, we’re able to redistribute economic value to sellers in the form of the most competitive price so that Sundae can become the largest buyer of homes that need love in the United States.

We are a Tier 1 Venture Capital backed company with product-market fit, scaling revenue, and a massive addressable market opportunity. Our team is composed of seasoned leaders from real estate and marketplace businesses and with significant high-growth company experience (Airbnb, Dropbox, Chime, LendingHome).

Joining Sundae means being part of the team that’s bringing compassion and transparency to the business of helping homeowners sell in their time of need. If you’re driven by making a positive impact on people’s lives and want to support our mission, we’d love to hear from you.

About The Role

We are looking for a Senior Backend Software Engineer to join our growing team! The right person for this role is someone who is excited about the Sundae mission, enjoys the challenges of a fast paced work environment and is a technologist at heart. As this is currently a small team and things are moving quickly, the role will evolve over time, and an open dialogue with your manager will shape the future direction of the responsibilities. Engineering best practices and architecture have been established, and this role will be instrumental in providing the feedback to improve and scale as we build out a best in class experience for our customers.

About You

You enjoy and seek environments where continuous improvement is expected, the growth of your teammates is valued just as much as your own. You are not afraid to speak your mind when it comes to the possibility of an improvement, but understand that there are effective ways to deliver feedback.
A high performing team, and all of its benefits, is a must.
In an ideal world, you spend all day coding, but recognize that your contributions to the team are equally important and could take away from coding.
You enjoy working closely with the stakeholders on other teams, you have a great deal of pride in how your work accomplishes the goals you share with the stakeholders.

Job Title: Senior Software Engineer
Reports to: Senior Director of Engineering
Location: Anywhere in the USA, Canada or Latin America

FranklinCovey Summary
Franklin Covey Co. (NYSE: FC) is one of the world's largest leadership companies with 1,000 employees, 1,500 clients and 2,000,000+ learners. We help organizations achieve greatness on the four people-related challenges that matter most: leadership, individual effectiveness, culture and business processes. Our unique approach combines content, technology and people to generate collective behavior change at scale. Our core product, the FranklinCovey All Access Pass®, provides companies access to 20+ courses in multiple modalities and in >20 languages. The All Access Pass has grown from $0 to $100MM in recurring revenue in the last five years, making it among the fastest growing products in edtech.

Role Context
Historically FC primarily offered in-person, one-off training. Over the last five years we have made substantial investments, and have had significant success, transitioning the business to an online, subscription product (AAP). In April ‘21 we acquired Strive, an edtech startup whose leadership development platform was used by leading tech cos like Slack, Airbnb, Pinterest and Intuit. Under the Strive's team direction and leadership, we are doubling down on the technology/product-centric approach and looking to build out a larger product and engineering team.

Role Summary
As a Senior Software Engineer, you will build products to help organizations train their employees and overcome their most pressing people-related problems at scale. You will work with product, design, data, and content teams to build a modern learning platform, scaling usage (and impact) 10-100x in the next year.

Core Job Responsibilities
Ideate: Engineers participate early in the product development process. You will review regular quantitative and qualitative research about our clients and learners and weigh in on the product strategy and roadmap.
Collaborate: You will partner with product, data and design to define the product features and functionality to ensure we're building the right thing at the right time and in the right way.
Build: You will ship regularly and iteratively, writing testable, readable and maintainable code.
Review & Architect: As a Senior Software Engineer you will play a leadership role in code reviews for the team, helping set the engineer bar, defining best practices, and weighing in on major architecture decisions.
Support: You will work with the sales, marketing, implementation and support teams to ensure users get the most value from the products you've built.

Job Requirements
5-10 years of experience building and shipping high-quality products (years of experience ≠ ability, so we'll use this as a proxy but not a hard requirement).
Back-end experience with Node.js, Python (Django), or Ruby on Rails and front-end experience with React preferred but not required. We're looking for great engineers and are confident that you can learn the language with time and direction.
Drive to continually improve and share knowledge with your teammates.
Ability and experience mentoring/guiding/developing more junior engineers with code reviews, best practice sharing, and architecture decisions.
Experience with performance, security, privacy, accessibility, and localization/globalization preferred but not required.
Experience architecting or refactoring systems of moderate complexity preferred but not required.

Why We Think This is a Great Opportunity
Interesting Product, Technical and Organizational Challenges – This year we will increase the number of users on Strive's learning platform 100 to 1000x. This will require us to solve a number of interesting product, technical and organizational challenges – whatever your unique interest is, there's likely a good challenge for you to work on.
Impact at Scale – FranklinCovey positively impacts the lives of millions of learners and tens of millions of their direct reports every year – FC directly teaches 4x as many learners in the US as all US business schools combined! By building out platform integrations for learning and planning in the flow of work, you'll substantially increase the quality of the learning experience and thus improve the skills and experiences of that enormous audience.
Startup Speed, Established Company Security – FranklinCovey's product & tech org is small relative to the company's learner/client scale, so you'll be able to move quickly to build a strategy and ship great products. Unlike a startup, FC is an established (and profitable!) publicly traded company, so you won't worry about the next funding round falling through and a lack of job security.

Company Information

We help organizations achieve results that require lasting changes in human behavior.

Why Ergatta?

Ergatta is changing the motivation that moves people. We are a team of bright, driven, and innovative thinkers on a mission to build a new consumer category: game-based home fitness. Our flagship product, the Ergatta Rower, provides a competitive and personalized full-body rowing workout through an engaging game-based interface. Our products are sustainably-made in New England from American cherrywood and designed to be on display.

As fitness activity increasingly shifts into the home, we believe the big winners will be those who innovate around what is on the screen. Our content provides a new and uniquely addictive consumer experience, radically different from traditional instructor-led offerings.

Ergatta recently closed a $30M Series A, led by Advanced Venture Partners and joined by Greycroft, Fifth Wall, Gaingels, and Hans Tung (GCV). Off the heels of that capital raise, we are expanding our game studio, breaking into new verticals, and continuing to challenge the way at-home fitness “should” look and feel.

However, above all else, we are investing in our company’s most important asset: our people.

Three Reasons to Join Ergatta:
Build something new - Rollerblade invented inline skating. Airbnb created home-sharing. Being a part of Ergatta is a chance to define a new frontier for fitness.
Be on the founding team - We are a small but mighty team. As a part of the first 75 founding team, you have an opportunity to shape the future of the company and product experience.
Define & accelerate your career - This is a place full of brilliant category experts to learn from, resources to take your career to the next level, and space to chart your own path.

Benefits and Perks:

Ergatta offers competitive salaries, stock options, health insurance with 100% premium covered, a 401(k) plan, in addition to:
Unlimited vacation & paid holidays - our philosophy is that life is all about balance, and we encourage our employees to take time off to recharge when they need it. We observe 12 paid holidays as a company, to unplug and celebrate with friends and family!
Paid Parental Leave - we want our employees to take time off and have a smooth, worry-free transition back to work when they’re welcoming a new member to the family!
Flexible work hours and WFH policy - the traditional workplace is evolving and we’re listening. We operate on a hybrid model, with some of our employees working fully remotely. Our NYC-based staff comes into the office twice a week and we offer WFH stipends to all full-time employees so they can be productive wherever they are working from.
Free Rower - we consider this an investment in your mental and physical wellbeing. Every Ergatta employee gets a free rower, and fully covered membership.
Weekly happy hours & regular company gatherings - simply put, we love spending time together! Ergatta employees know how to have fun (we even have an illustrious “Party Planning Committee!”) and we get together as a group - both in person and virtually - whenever possible.

Ergatta champions diversity and is an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, age, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, veteran or disability status.

We've raised $70m in funding from the likes of NEA, Emergence Capital, and Stripe itself. You'll be joining a special group of people who learned the ropes at companies like Stripe, Google, Palantir, Atlassian, Twitter, Airbnb, Looker, NEA, Bain, and more!

Signs of traction

Over the last year and a half, we've achieved several significant growth milestones, including:
Growing revenue by 5x while also delivering a 200+% NRR (net revenue retention)
Tripling our customer base, with notable new customers including Zoom, Asana, Wynn, Color Genomics, and Restaurants Brands International in addition to existing customers like Etsy, Stripe, Monzo, Notion, and others

Launching several new product updates, including a revamped scheduling experience, agent scorecard, algorithmic scheduling automations, reporting API endpoints, and contact platform integrations
Forming additional strategic partnerships with leading customer experience companies, including UJET, Five9, and MaestroQA

We've been fortunate to serve a fast-growing user base. In 2021 alone, we're serving >3x the number of customers and an order of magnitude more support agents. To support this demand, we've had to rework critical components of our infrastructure.

Some examples include improving our caching to deliver millions of real-time, user-facing metrics or building data pipelines to support ML models that predict volume and generate staffing requirements. This team might be right for you if:
You have extensive cloud computing knowledge, from storage, to compute, to networking, to deploying. Our team uses primarily AWS for this, so prior experience in AWS would be a plus but not required
You have built large scale continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
You have orchestrated and managed large scale data platforms such as Airflow, Kafka, or Jenkins
You have built a wide range of developer tools and systems that can help enable product engineers to safely and efficiently ship out new features, such as end to end testing, canary deploys, automatic regressions testing.

Responsibilities
Ensure site stability: At any given time, this might mean addressing server resource issues, resolving network outages, or investigating database performance regressions. You would be helping us enhance every facet of our infrastructure, from the barebones machine monitoring to designing alert flows so that the right teams can be notified of issues.
Improve developer tooling: With experience at companies like Airbnb and Stripe, we understand the causal link between infrastructure and product velocity. We're investing in scaling our code base and adding developer tools to balance shipping code quickly with high code quality and site reliability.
Deploy and maintain high-leverage systems: We utilize systems like PostgreSQL as our primary data store, Redis for caching, Amazon SQS for queueing, Grafana for monitoring, and more. You will be responsible for the full portfolio of systems, including scoping and deploying new ones (e.g. Kubernetes or Docker) as well as maintaining, deprecating, and/or refactoring usage patterns of the existing systems.
Design high throughput data ingestion pipelines: At our core, we are a data analysis company. Every day we sync millions of ticket and agent states data, and on top of that we compute derived metrics on this data. You would help us up level our existing metrics pipelines so we can support the ever growing throughput of data ingestion.
Wear many hats: In addition to writing and reviewing code, you'll find yourself talking to users, planning the roadmap, brainstorming positioning, interviewing future teammates, and collaborating with the Business team on product releases and launches.

We are building a modern and aspirational banking experience by bringing rewards and benefits to the everyday debit card.

Why this role?
Build a mobile banking app that you would actually use. Seriously, we're challenging the status quo and building a premium debit card to align incentives with our members. Step aside Amex.
Work alongside a lean and highly-talented team. One of our co-founders designed the interface of the first iPhone and we launched and scaled to millions of dollars in transactional volume with a team of 2.5 engineers — ask us about it.
Our team is super collaborative and transparent. You have impact across the entire company from new product features, internal tools, or jamming on a marketing idea — no shortage of things to work on.
We're well-funded and supported by top investors — we're backed by the same investors behind companies like Airbnb, Stripe, Notion, and many others.

What does a backend engineer do?
You will work to ensure integrations with key vendors are stable and reliable — our card issuer, card printer, identity verification vendors, Plaid, etc.
You will build the backend logic that powers new features. Potential examples: instant bank transfers, custom rewards — features that will enable to attract and retain more members.
You will build scalable infrastructure that can handle very large amounts of data with low latency.

This role would be a good fit if you...
Have been working as a backend engineer for 3+ years with at least 2 of them using Node.js, AWS, PostgresQL, and GraphQL. Usually language experience doesn't really matter to us but we're moving quickly and would like for you to have experience with our current stack.
Worked at a really small start up that went from 0 → 1 and understand how to scale backend systems.
Are thoughtful with balancing moving quickly and cautiously by testing software before shipping — given the sensitive nature of our product we need to ensure is reliable and secure at all times.
Have spent time working in a senior engineer role but are still excited about being a core contributor to the codebase.
Actually care about building a consumer product that has thoughtful and intuitive design across the stack — from mobile app UI to the database architecture.

Perks:
Competitive salary and stock options based on experience
401k
Full health benefits (medical, dental, and vision insurance).
20-day vacation policy. Can roll over up to 10 days per year. And we shut down the office in between Christmas and New Year's. Flexible WFH and sick day allowance.
Education Credits: $25/mo. Keep learning — books, courses, training, etc.
Wellness Credits: $50/mo. Take care of yourself — gym, fitness classes, meditation, etc.
Commute Credits: $100/mo. Don't stress rush hour — public transit, bike, lyft, etc.

Each of our communities is unique, but they are all powered by our custom-built platform which our members like to call “the Braintrust.” We think of the Braintrust as the next evolution of the professional community platform (e.g., LinkedIn 2.0), and it’s one of the strategic pillars supporting our mission to help working professionals do their day-to-day jobs better and progress throughout their careers.

We are a well-funded, profitable, and rapidly scaling startup with a high-impact team of 20.

What Makes Us Unique

We fill a painful hole in the market at an unprecedented time in history. As professionals struggle to navigate an increasingly complex business environment, the right information and perspective has become harder and harder to find. The dominant networking platforms of the day are too broad and diluted to be effective resources, and it has become difficult to parse through the noise and misinformation to hone in on what really matters. Professionals are rapidly retreating back to private, trusted communities for their information, support, and their most interesting conversations.

That’s where we come in. We connect professionals to their most valuable resource - their peers - through a highly-curated collection of professional communities. In addition to attending live events, our members get access to the Braintrust, which is a comprehensive networking and research platform. After logging in, members are immediately connected with their closest peers, and are able to leverage their knowledge and experience for advice, service provider recommendations, benchmarking data, peer coaching/mentorship, and informal “therapy” sessions. The Braintrust also features a resource library with hundreds of educational videos, forms, and other materials from our community events. A Beta version of the Braintrust is already in-market, with significant user engagement and revenue.

Aware Healthcare,Founding Mobile Engineer (iOS/Android),"San Francisco, CA","Founding Mobile Engineer (iOS/Android), Aware Healthcare, San Francisco, CA, Medical, Vision, Dental, +1 benefit, Hide job, Your profile matches this job, 4 weeks ago, 1 applicant","TL;DR: Fast-growing early-stage mental health tech startup seeking a software engineer with 5+ years of building, and prior experience at an early-stage fast-growing startup, to lead our iOS and Android mobile development. You'll be one of the first 5 employees at a fully-funded and commercially-flourishing startup. Together, we'll reinvent therapy and change the mental health of millions. Details below!

About Us:

Aware Healthcare is turning therapy from an art to a science. We're a venture-backed startup, on a mission to create the highest quality mental health care franchise in the world.

Every day, 100 million Americans struggle with a mental health issue, yet only 10% are receiving care based on science. That's why we're building a new mental health care system driven by data, where patients receive individualized care, clinicians deliver proven treatments, and insurance pays for outcomes not sessions.

While the rest of our industry is optimizing for quantity, we are laser focused on quality. Leveraging our data platform, we recently landed contracts with 6 of the top 7 insurance companies, which unlock access to 111M Americans and pay higher rates than any competitor.

We have raised $5.7mm from top executives at Google, PayPal, Lyft, and AirBnB and investors who previously funded Square, Instacart, Twilio, GrubHub, StitchFix, OpenDoor, and SpaceX. We were founded in 2020 by AJ Goldstein (previously early at Calm and Oura) and are based in San Francisco CA. You can learn more about Aware here: https://www.awarehc.com/

This will be a senior role within the company, where you will be leading our iOS and Android application development and strategy.

…

The Technical Challenge:

We are building the largest digital dataset of an individual's mental health using data from their personal IoT devices (e.g. smartphones, wearables, laptops, smart homes, connected cars).

To do this, we need to build scalable and reliable systems to ingest and process that data, and create innovative user experiences for therapists and patients to get better sooner.

100 million people are currently struggling with a mental health issue in the US alone. This is a problem with a huge scale, and even bigger engineering opportunity.

These are the 4 main challenges your teams will be tackling:
Mobile App Development: Collecting data from the operating systems of smartphones, and remaining nimble to the impact of new versions of iOS and Android.
Product Development: Meticulously designing and developing the user experience for the patients and providers using our products to save and change lives.
Integrations: Building new integrations that allow high-quality data to be consistently sourced and aggregated from smartphones, wearables, and more.
Security and Compliance: Ensuring Aware's platform is HIPAA compliant, and securing very personal data with best-in-class data privacy protocols.

At this stage, we're looking for a rockstar. Someone ready to take ownership over our mobile applications and mobile data collection integrations. You should be someone who is excited about the opportunity to have autonomy over mission-critical applications and take Aware's experience and platform to the next level with your contributions.

Apptegy,Senior Back-End Engineer,"Little Rock, AR","Senior Back-End Engineer, Apptegy, Little Rock, AR, Medical, Vision, Dental, 401(k), Hide job, 1 company alumnus works here, 1 month ago, 0 applicants","About Apptegy

Since our start in 2015, we’ve gone from a group of individuals to a community pushing toward the same goal of building a fantastic company with great people, great products, and, most importantly, a great culture. To date, we have grown from a handful of school districts in Arkansas to thousands of school districts across the U.S.

Apptegy is building products to empower school leaders to run better schools. We have the opportunity to help schools as they go through a radical shift in how they operate and to provide great technology to make that transition.

We are growing quickly and are focused on bringing thoughtful, high-performers together to craft an experience for our clients and to make Apptegy a better place than it already is.

What we’ve built and are building:

Apptegy works with thousands of schools and school districts across the United States. For the past 6 years, we’ve been working on making our technology into a breath of fresh air. School leaders, superintendents and administrators have some of the most stressful and demanding jobs in the world. They are responsible for the safety, well-being, and education of thousands of students. Every day they juggle the roles of politician, disciplinarian, visionary, and accountant.

That’s why we focus on simplicity. By making everything simple, we lower the technical barrier so that any administrator can lead with the most powerful tools available.

In short, we are enabling school leaders to brand, market, and strengthen their schools. Amazing events and happenings occur in schools every day and our technology allows that to be shared across web, mobile, social media, and alerts with a single, simple-to-use tool.

As a Senior Back-End Engineer you will...
Write beautiful code in Ruby and Rails (often for new features, new products/platforms)
Work with a SCRUM team with other backend engineers and front-end (Vue.js) engineers, QA/Test, and DevOps engineers
Discuss the best architecture for a feature and dive deep into Design Patterns
Work with and assist other engineers to think through architectural decisions
Write clear documentation with the help of Product and Tech Ops
Use good coding standards (best framework and language idioms)
Work closely with Product Managers and Engineering leaders (CTO & VPs)

At Apptegy, we use Ruby on Rails, one of the modern programming languages used by companies like Shopify, Airbnb, GitHub, Crunchbase, Groupon, to build our platforms. While our backend engineers work in Ruby and Rails, we are looking for an experienced senior engineer to join our team regardless of direct experience with Ruby or Rails in the past. If you enjoy building meaningful technology with thoughtful teams and you’re still interested in a challenge, we want to talk to you about what it’s like to work in Engineering at Apptegy.

What is expected of engineers at Apptegy?

We expect a lot of our engineers. We’ve been able to build an exceptional team that cares about their work and each other. We are incredibly proud of our team. We are also fortunate to have the opportunity to build products, platforms, and features that empower schools and school leaders to highlight their strengths and give the best opportunities to their students.

Self-driven & Always Learning: At Apptegy, we believe that the right people are intrinsically motivated. We have built a team of engineers that enjoy learning and take that responsibility seriously. Whether they are starting out on their career or well into their experience, they are still looking to improve on their weaknesses and to use their strengths to help others.

In short, they are naturally motivated to do meaningful work and they own their learning experience.

To quote one experienced engineer who joined Apptegy in 2020, “People here are like some sort of crack squad of commandos. They are running into what needs doing and doing it. They’re more likely to do too much than too little. This is an excellent team.”

An interest in Culture and Code: We reject the stereotype that engineers want to be left alone to work. In our experience, engineers care deeply about culture, empathy, and enjoying the people they work with. Many of our best engineers were as curious about culture as anyone in People or HR would be.

We have been able to create a high-performing and thoughtful culture across the company and that extends to and is made better by Engineering. That means you get time to do great work and you get to be surrounded by people who care about their work and you.

Speak up: In some companies, engineers have to wait their turn to speak up. You have to have a minimum number of years of experience to have a voice at the table. Or if you’re a senior engineer, you need to hold off until you’ve gained the trust of the veteran engineers.

At Apptegy, you have a voice from the start. Some of the best ideas have come from junior engineers that see things differently. We want the best ideas to win— no matter who it comes from. And those times when the best idea comes from someone else are an opportunity for you to learn and to increase your learning process.

What is true of you?

An aptitude for challenge & a track record of success:
Deep experience as a software engineer involving both deciding feature and/or platform architecture, writing code, and writing tests for your code
10+ years of experience with a focus on back end
Strong experience in a top-level database system (ideally PostgreSQL, but others work also)
You’ve picked up and mastered a modern language (e.g. Python, PHP, Dot-NET MVC, SailsJS ) and new technologies outside your comfort zone
Working closely with other software engineers to accomplish larger objectives

What else should I know?

We take our responsibility as a company seriously and aim to make this the best job that you’ve had (and one that sets you up for future success).

We want your day at work and your time at home to be a joyful experience, that’s why we provide:
Medical, dental, vision insurance for you and dependents
Matching 401(k) retirement plan
Discretionary/flexible paid time off policy

The Greylock talent team and I have supported thousands of people through this journey over the years to discover the right opportunity for their careers and motivations.

If you have a deeper desire to make a larger impact, help shape a company's culture, accelerate your own career growth, or possibly start a company someday... we are always happy to connect proactively with talented software engineers to offer advice and build a connection now, even if the timing is not immediate.

Apptegy,Senior Back-End Engineer,"Dallas, TX","Senior Back-End Engineer, Apptegy, Dallas, TX, Hide job, 1 company alumnus works here, 6 months ago","What we’ve built and are building:

Apptegy works with thousands of schools and school districts across the United States. For the past 6 years, we’ve been working on making our technology into a breath of fresh air. School leaders, superintendents and administrators have some of the most stressful and demanding jobs in the world. They are responsible for the safety, well-being, and education of thousands of students. Every day they juggle the roles of politician, disciplinarian, visionary, and accountant.

That’s why we focus on simplicity. By making everything simple, we lower the technical barrier so that any administrator can lead with the most powerful tools available.

In short, we are enabling school leaders to brand, market, and strengthen their schools. Amazing events and happenings occur in schools every day and our technology allows that to be shared across web, mobile, social media, and alerts with a single, simple-to-use tool.

As a Senior Back-End Engineer you will...
Write beautiful code in Ruby and Rails (often for new features, new products/platforms)
Work with a SCRUM team with other backend engineers and front-end (Vue.js) engineers, QA/Test, and DevOps engineers
Discuss the best architecture for a feature and dive deep into Design Patterns
Work with and assist other engineers to think through architectural decisions
Write clear documentation with the help of Product and Tech Ops
Use good coding standards (best framework and language idioms)
Work closely with Product Managers and Engineering leaders (CTO & VPs)

At Apptegy, we use Ruby on Rails, one of the modern programming languages used by companies like Shopify, Airbnb, GitHub, Crunchbase, Groupon, to build our platforms. While our backend engineers work in Ruby and Rails, we are looking for an experienced senior engineer to join our team regardless of direct experience with Ruby or Rails in the past. If you enjoy building meaningful technology with thoughtful teams and you’re still interested in a challenge, we want to talk to you about what it’s like to work in Engineering at Apptegy.

What is expected of engineers at Apptegy?

We expect a lot of our engineers. We’ve been able to build an exceptional team that cares about their work and each other. We are incredibly proud of our team. We are also fortunate to have the opportunity to build products, platforms, and features that empower schools and school leaders to highlight their strengths and give the best opportunities to their students.

Self-driven & Always Learning: At Apptegy, we believe that the right people are intrinsically motivated. We have built a team of engineers that enjoy learning and take that responsibility seriously. Whether they are starting out on their career or well into their experience, they are still looking to improve on their weaknesses and to use their strengths to help others.

In short, they are naturally motivated to do meaningful work and they own their learning experience.

To quote one experienced engineer who joined Apptegy in 2020, “People here are like some sort of crack squad of commandos. They are running into what needs doing and doing it. They’re more likely to do too much than too little. This is an excellent team.”

An interest in Culture and Code: We reject the stereotype that engineers want to be left alone to work. In our experience, engineers care deeply about culture, empathy, and enjoying the people they work with. Many of our best engineers were as curious about culture as anyone in People or HR would be.

We have been able to create a high-performing and thoughtful culture across the company and that extends to and is made better by Engineering. That means you get time to do great work and you get to be surrounded by people who care about their work and you.

Speak up: In some companies, engineers have to wait their turn to speak up. You have to have a minimum number of years of experience to have a voice at the table. Or if you’re a senior engineer, you need to hold off until you’ve gained the trust of the veteran engineers.

At Apptegy, you have a voice from the start. Some of the best ideas have come from junior engineers that see things differently. We want the best ideas to win— no matter who it comes from.

FranklinCovey,Software Engineer (Admin Platform),United States,"Software Engineer (Admin Platform), FranklinCovey, United States, Remote, Hide job, Actively recruiting, 1 week ago, 7 applicants","Job Description
Title: Software Engineer (Admin Platform)
Reports to: Director, Digital Platforms
Location: Anywhere in the US, Canada, or Latin America

Job Summary
FranklinCovey is one of the world’s largest and most trusted leadership development companies, helping individuals and organizations realize their potential. As a Software Engineer on the Admin Platform team, you will partner with product and design to build an Admin Platform to help 1,700+ clients easily launch, manage and measure impact journeys. These impact journeys will reach, teach and transform the lives of 2,000,000+ working learners (you’ll impact 4x as many learners as all US business schools combined).

Role Context
Historically FC primarily offered in-person, event-based training. Over the last five years, we have made substantial investments, and have had significant success, transitioning the business to an online, subscription product (AAP). In April ‘21, FC acquired Strive, an edtech startup whose leadership development platform was used by leading tech companies like Slack, Airbnb, Pinterest and Intuit. We are now doubling down on our technology/product-centric approach and building out a significantly larger product and engineering team.

Why We Think This is a Great Opportunity
Interesting Product, Technical and Organizational Challenges – In the coming year we expect to increase usage on our Admin and Impact Platforms by 10x. This will require us to solve a number of interesting product, technical and organizational challenges.
Impact at Scale – FranklinCovey positively impacts the lives of millions of learners and tens of millions of their direct reports every year – FC directly teaches 4x as many learners as all US business schools combined! By building an Admin Platform that helps clients easily launch, manage and measure impact journeys, you’ll generate substantial impact at scale.
Startup Speed, Established Company Security – FranklinCovey's product & tech org is small relative to the company's learner/client scale, so you'll be able to move quickly to build a strategy and ship great products. Unlike a startup, FC is an established (and profitable!) publicly traded company, so you won't worry about the next funding round falling through and a lack of job security.

Essential Job Functions
Collaborate: You will partner with product, data and design to define the product features and functionality to ensure we're building the right thing at the right time and in the right way.
Build: You will ship regularly and iteratively, writing testable, readable and maintainable code.
Review & Architect: As a Senior Software Engineer you will play a leadership role in code reviews for the team, helping set the engineering bar, defining best practices, and weighing in on major architecture decisions.
Support: You will work with the sales, marketing, implementation and support teams to ensure users get the most value from the products you've built.

Job Requirements
3-10 years of experience building and shipping high-quality products (years of experience ≠ ability, this is a proxy but not a hard requirement)
Back-end experience with PHP and MySQL/PostgreSQL and front-end experience with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML is preferred but not required. We're looking for great engineers and are confident that you can learn the language with time and direction.
Drive to continually improve and share knowledge with your teammates.
Ability and experience mentoring/guiding/developing more junior engineers with code reviews, best practice sharing, and architecture decisions
Experience with performance, security, privacy, accessibility, and localization/globalization preferred but not required.
Experience architecting or refactoring systems of moderate complexity preferred but not required

Apptegy,Senior Front-End Engineer,"Little Rock, AR","Senior Front-End Engineer, Apptegy, Little Rock, AR, Medical, Vision, Dental, 401(k), Hide job, 1 company alumnus works here, 3 months ago, 0 applicants","About Apptegy

Since our start in 2015, we’ve gone from a group of individuals to a community pushing toward the same goal of building a fantastic company with great people, great products, and, most importantly, a great culture. To date, we have grown from a handful of school districts in Arkansas to thousands of school districts across the U.S.

Apptegy is building products to empower school leaders to run better schools. We have the opportunity to help schools as they go through a radical shift in how they operate and to provide great technology to make that transition.

We are growing quickly and are focused on bringing thoughtful, high-performers together to craft an experience for our clients and to make Apptegy a better place than it already is.

What we’ve built and are building:

Apptegy works with thousands of schools and school districts across the United States. For the past 6 years, we’ve been working on making our technology into a breath of fresh air. School leaders, superintendents and administrators have some of the most stressful and demanding jobs in the world. They are responsible for the safety, well-being, and education of thousands of students. Every day they juggle the roles of politician, disciplinarian, visionary, and accountant.

That’s why we focus on simplicity. By making everything simple, we lower the technical barrier so that any administrator can lead with the most powerful tools available.

In short, we are enabling school leaders to brand, market, and strengthen their schools. Amazing events and happenings occur in schools every day and our technology allows that to be shared across web, mobile, social media, and alerts with a single, simple-to-use tool.

As a Senior Front-End Engineer you will...
Work with a SCRUM team with other front-end engineers, Ruby on Rails engineers, and Product Owners
Translate new designs into code to build new platforms, products, and features
Write beautiful javascript in Vue.js
Learn from other engineers and share your own knowledge
Critique designs, suggest improvements to UI/UX, and overall experience
Write clear documentation with the help of Product and Tech Ops
Use good coding standards (best framework and language idioms)
Work closely with Product Managers and Engineering leaders (CTO & VP)

At Apptegy, we use Ruby on Rails, one of the modern programming languages used by companies like Shopify, Airbnb, GitHub, Crunchbase, Groupon, to build our platforms. While our backend engineers work in Ruby and Rails, we are looking for an experienced senior engineer to join our team regardless of direct experience with Ruby or Rails in the past. If you enjoy building meaningful technology with thoughtful teams and you’re still interested in a challenge, we want to talk to you about what it’s like to work in Engineering at Apptegy.

What is expected of engineers at Apptegy?

We expect a lot of our engineers. We’ve been able to build an exceptional team that cares about their work and each other. We are incredibly proud of our team. We are also fortunate to have the opportunity to build products, platforms, and features that empower schools and school leaders to highlight their strengths and give the best opportunities to their students.

Self-driven & Always Learning: At Apptegy, we believe that the right people are intrinsically motivated. We have built a team of engineers that enjoy learning and take that responsibility seriously. Whether they are starting out on their career or well into their experience, they are still looking to improve on their weaknesses and to use their strengths to help others.

In short, they are naturally motivated to do meaningful work and they own their learning experience.

To quote one experienced engineer who joined Apptegy in 2020, “People here are like some sort of crack squad of commandos. They are running into what needs doing and doing it. They’re more likely to do too much than too little. This is an excellent team.”

An interest in Culture and Code: We reject the stereotype that engineers want to be left alone to work. In our experience, engineers care deeply about culture, empathy, and enjoying the people they work with. Many of our best engineers were as curious about culture as anyone in People or HR would be.

We have been able to create a high-performing and thoughtful culture across the company and that extends to and is made better by Engineering. That means you get time to do great work and you get to be surrounded by people who care about their work and you.

Speak up: In some companies, engineers have to wait their turn to speak up. You have to have a minimum number of years of experience to have a voice at the table. Or if you’re a senior engineer, you need to hold off until you’ve gained the trust of the veteran engineers.

At Apptegy, you have a voice from the start. Some of the best ideas have come from junior engineers that see things differently. We want the best ideas to win— no matter who it comes from. And those times when the best idea comes from someone else are an opportunity for you to learn and to increase your learning process.

What is true of you?

An aptitude for challenge & a track record of success:
You have completed a four-year college degree ideally in Computer Science or similar, or without a technical degree, you have experience building successful products and platforms for 5+ years on an engineering team
You have an impressive track record in your academic and work history
3+ years of experience in Javascript and ES6+
Knowledge of and experience with front-end frameworks (Vue.js, React, or Angular)
Experience with raw CSS and frameworks
Experience writing tests for your code
Experience working on an engineering team

What else should I know?

We take our responsibility as a company seriously and aim to make this the best job that you’ve had (and one that sets you up for future success).

We want your day at work and your time at home to be a joyful experience, that’s why we provide:
Medical, dental, vision insurance for you and dependents
Matching 401(k) retirement plan
Discretionary/flexible paid time off policy
Parental leaveDependent Care FSA
Annual Travel Stipend

If the challenge of building a rapidly growing startup excites you as much as it does us, we hope that you’ll consider joining us."

Cardless is a fintech startup. Our mission is to make consumer credit more accessible, useful, and engaging, and we do that by partnering with brands to help them launch financial products.

We've begun with a focus on co-branded credit cards. We've launched cards with Manchester United, the Boston Celtics, Liverpool F.C. (click here to see a full list of all our cards); and we have more exciting brands on the way! Our cards are digital-first, consumer-friendly, and tailored to both brands & fans with delightful discounts & rewards.

Here's how fintech could disrupt credit card rewards by View from the Wing
Forget free flights, this card could make you an NBA benchwarmer by Bloomberg

We're headquartered in San Francisco, but we're building a remote-friendly team across the continental US. We were founded in 2019, and we last raised a $40M Series B in 2021. Our investors include top VCs like Activant, Accomplice, and Greycroft; founders from successful startups like Plaid, SeatGeek, and FiveStars; and executives from major sports teams like the Boston Celtics and Phoenix Suns.

The Role

Powering digital-first and consumer-friendly credit cards is no easy task! Behind the scenes, we need to integrate with a number of third-party services (like card networks, payment processors, and credit bureaus), solve tricky distributed systems problems (like eventual consistency and idempotent workflows), and balance moving fast with moving reliably, securely, and safely.

We've achieved much of that to date with a small but talented team of generalist engineers. We're now seeking a dedicated infra/devops engineer to own both our production infrastructure and our developer experience. In many ways, we'd love for this engineer to own the tech, tooling, and roadmap for our entire development+deployment lifecycle. And if it interests you, this role can transition into people management as we grow, though that'll never be a requirement.

Our Picture Today

Our backend stack today is a microservices architecture built primarily with Java & gRPC on AWS. We use several AWS tools & services, like EKS (hosted Kubernetes), API Gateway, Lambda, Step Functions, DynamoDB, Kinesis, Redshift, S3, and managed Airflow. We also use other tools & services like VeryGoodSecurity for tokenization, LaunchDarkly for feature flagging & experimentation, and Retool for internal admin UI.

We write some infra-as-code with Terraform, though we want to do more here. We CI/CD to staging using CircleCI & Harness, and manually deploy to prod once a week. We've invested in unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, and we've also made progress towards a single monorepo. We monitor & observe our systems through Datadog & Sentry, and we work hard to keep our on-call rotation page-free and stress-free. We also maintain a data pipeline through tools & services like FiveTran & DBT Cloud.

We'd love for you to bring your experience and help us get to the next level across these fronts:
More infra-as-code (""cattle, not pets""). Is our current approach with Terraform still right, or should we revisit anything, e.g. reconsider AWS CloudFormation? Importantly, we'd love to broaden this to include things like database schema changes too. E.g. how can we achieve safe, code-reviewed schema migrations common in the SQL world with our NoSQL DynamoDB?
Continuous deployment to production too, not just staging. Many of the best companies continuously deploy many times a day, both to shorten developers' feedback loop and (counterintuitively) to reduce risk (since each change is smaller and more isolated). We'd love to get here, but we know that doing so responsibly means we should have great testing, monitoring/alerting, and rollback stories. How close are we, and what should our roadmap be to getting there?
Move to a true monorepo, using e.g. Bazel or Buck. We experienced the pain of having a separate repo per service, and we successfully consolidated most of our services to a single Java monorepo. But we still have a few other repos, like a Python one which houses Lambda functions, Airflow jobs, and integration tests. We'd love to finish the last mile here, but we know that'll require a bit more sophistication than we have today.
Better observability & debuggability. We've invested in logging, tracing, and metrics; we've refined our on-call dashboards; and we've tuned our monitors & alerts to reduce false positives — but bugs still feel hard to figure out sometimes, and we still need to minimize false negatives too. Is there low-hanging fruit here, or should we revisit our approaches?
Explicitly define & measure our reliability. By typical measurements of reliability (e.g. uptime/availability and latency), our systems are pretty reliable today. E.g. we almost never get paged for our own system issues today. But we also depend on third-party services, and our customers are also affected by bugs, not just downtime or latency. How should we define our reliability then, and how should we measure it to know if we're healthy or not?

You may see a theme here: we hold ourselves to a high bar and value excellence, but we also value pragmatism and customer impact. If this resonates with you and our aspirations excite you, reach out!

The Requirements

Research has shown that women & underrepresented minorities read lists of requirements and consider themselves unqualified if they don't meet every single one. This list represents what we're ideally looking for, but we encourage you to apply even if you don't meet everything 100%. Everyone has unique strengths & weaknesses, and we hire for strength & potential, not lack of weakness.
Experience shipping, extending, and maintaining production infra in AWS. You should be proficient in key AWS technologies like EC2, VPC, IAM, and security groups, and know best practices and tradeoffs. This is more important to us than a specific # of years of experience, but we expect most candidates to need at least 3-5 years in the industry to gain this expertise.
At least some experience with modern infra abstractions & tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform or similar, and Lambda. These things are learnable, but some existing exposure to concepts, details, and tradeoffs here will be valuable.
Experience managing your own work and supporting others. We want this lead-level engineer to own and manage our infra & developer experience roadmap. Doing that effectively will require proactively communicating proposals, reasoning, and status. You'll also play a key role in teaching, mentoring, and leveling up other engineers.
An ownership mindset, and a passion for both your craft (building things right) and achieving real-world impact (building the right things for our business & team).

Our Values

We believe that the best companies are the ones that successfully align their vision and values, that match their decision making processes, hiring criteria, and overall operating principles to the change they’re striving to make. We're willing to spend significant time and resources to be above average at the following things, because we believe that will lead to long term success.
Be curious and be the solution. We work in a complex space. In order to be successful, we must think globally and collaborate cross-functionally. We ask thoughtful questions without judgment and propose comprehensive solutions that address the full picture. We are all owners at Cardless — mindful and empowered.
Start with the customer. Our customers are our priority. Our care for them drives our actions. The first question we always ask is: how will this impact the customer? We make every decision, no matter how big or small, with the customer top of mind.
Move fast and build things. We are a startup in a highly regulated space, so we must execute with both speed and precision. We achieve this through deliberate focus, methodical preparation, and disciplined execution. We build, learn, improve, and repeat.
A place to do your best work. We are a team, and we achieve more together than apart. At Cardless, we want to see each other succeed: we take as much pride in each other’s work as our own. We celebrate and seek out diversity of experience, thought, and background in order to accelerate both individual and company growth. We're hungry, we're passionate, and we’re inspired to achieve great things together.

Why Ergatta?

Ergatta is changing the motivation that moves people. We are a team of bright, driven, and innovative thinkers on a mission to build a new consumer category: game-based home fitness. Our flagship product, the Ergatta Rower, provides a competitive and personalized full-body rowing workout through an engaging game-based interface. Our products are sustainably-made in New England from American cherrywood and designed to be on display.

As fitness activity increasingly shifts into the home, we believe the big winners will be those who innovate around what is on the screen. Our content provides a new and uniquely addictive consumer experience, radically different from traditional instructor-led offerings.

Ergatta recently closed a $30M Series A, led by Advanced Venture Partners and joined by Greycroft, Fifth Wall, Gaingels, and Hans Tung (GCV). Off the heels of that capital raise, we are expanding our game studio, breaking into new verticals, and continuing to challenge the way at-home fitness “should” look and feel.

However, above all else, we are investing in our company’s most important asset: our people.

Three Reasons to Join Ergatta:
Build something new - Rollerblade invented inline skating. Airbnb created home-sharing. Being a part of Ergatta is a chance to define a new frontier for fitness.
Be on the founding team - We are a small but mighty team. As a part of the first 75 founding team, you have an opportunity to shape the future of the company and product experience.
Define & accelerate your career - This is a place full of brilliant category experts to learn from, resources to take your career to the next level, and space to chart your own path.

Benefits and Perks:

Ergatta offers competitive salaries, stock options, health insurance with 100% premium covered, a 401(k) plan, in addition to:
Unlimited vacation & paid holidays - our philosophy is that life is all about balance, and we encourage our employees to take time off to recharge when they need it. We observe 12 paid holidays as a company, to unplug and celebrate with friends and family!
Paid Parental Leave - we want our employees to take time off and have a smooth, worry-free transition back to work when they’re welcoming a new member to the family!
Flexible work hours and WFH policy - the traditional workplace is evolving and we’re listening. We operate on a hybrid model, with some of our employees working fully remotely. Our NYC-based staff comes into the office twice a week and we offer WFH stipends to all full-time employees so they can be productive wherever they are working from.
Free Rower - we consider this an investment in your mental and physical wellbeing. Every Ergatta employee gets a free rower, and fully covered membership.
Weekly happy hours & regular company gatherings - simply put, we love spending time together! Ergatta employees know how to have fun (we even have an illustrious “Party Planning Committee!”) and we get together as a group - both in person and virtually - whenever possible.

Ergatta champions diversity and is an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, age, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, veteran or disability status.

We look forward to meeting you,

Help define our product roadmap through ideation and your knowledge of backend development.
Mentor and provide technical leadership both for your teammates and within the larger open source community.
Participate in the engineering team’s on-call rotation (mostly during business hours owing to our distributed team).

Requirements
5+ years of real world experience building and operating (scaling, debugging) complex backend systems.
CS/Software Engineering degree or proven understanding of CS fundamentals.
Some experience in a low level language such as C, Rust or Go (i.e not a scripting language).

Bonus: Experience working with web browser internals and/or Node.js.

Why work here?

👩‍💻 Work with brilliant frontend people who helped create core frontend tech for thousands of companies from Airbnb to Zenefits. Three times. In a row. Meteor, Apollo GraphQL, and now Storybook. Learn more
💥 Have a big impact and learn a ton by working across open source, cloud services, and developer experience. You’ll ship products you can be proud of.

“If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the people to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.”

Here Are Highlights Of Our Benefits Package

Competitive Compensation - We monitor industry salaries annually and make sure we’re paying in the top tier based on skills and experience, for every position at the company. Base salaries are standardized on the Colorado market (our headquarters).

Remote-Friendly - We hire the most talented technologists from across the country and are committed to being a remote-first company. We want you to perform at your best, and promise to help you feel comfortable and connected wherever you call home.

Flexible Work Schedules - We treat our people like adults and trust you to manage your schedule. We offer flexible hours to align with your work style.

Unlimited Vacation - Taking time off to promote health and wellness is crucial to your well being. There's no prescribed vacation or sick day policies. If you’re feeling under the weather or need a mental health day, take time to recharge, it's good for you!

100% Health Coverage - We pay 100% of your medical, dental, and vision insurance premiums.

401k Match - Saving for retirement and investing in your financial future is important. That’s why Gray matches 401K contributions up to 6% of your salary.

Wellness Allowance -We want you to do your best work, and we know that your health and happiness are critical to making that happen. We offer up to $50.00 per month reimbursement toward whatever it is that heals you-yoga class, acupuncture-you name it!

Publishing and Speaking Opportunities - We encourage you to be thought leaders and share your knowledge and expertise. Let's build a more interconnected, diverse, and prosperous digital services community together.

Swag Budget - New hires receive a gift certificate to Gray’s curated online store of branded merchandise. We promise it’s quality merch you’ll enjoy. Take a peek and see for yourself. We’re regularly adding new products.

Mission and Public Good Impact - We are brought together by a shared commitment to do work that matters. You’ll work on projects that transform government services, strengthen national defense and are critical to the well-being of millions of Americans.

Work-life balance. Whether you need to take a midday run or step out to pick up your kid from childcare, we want to see your best self at Gray - that means helping you lead a healthy life outside of work.

Our mission is bold, audacious, and there’s a lot on the line. It’s a significant career move, and we appreciate the courage and passion that go into considering us. We look forward to hearing from you.

About Us:

Braintree lets you move money from one place to another safely and securely. Every time you pay for an Uber ride, book a stay through Airbnb, or pay with PayPal when you check out online, you’re probably using our product. It sounds complex (and it is), but we make it so simple you can’t tell we’re there. We solve world-scale problems and provide opportunities to match. We build diverse teams that recognize our strengths and allow us to work on our weaknesses. You bring skills and a relentless focus on the customer, and we'll provide the support you need to do the best work of your life.

Communication is key to our process, and we don't want to hinder it with walls. Many teams program in pairs, which means you always have another set of eyes to help you.
We practice test-driven development and believe that it helps us deliver simple solutions focused on real customer needs. We have no QA department – developers test, release and monitor their own code.

Wisetack,Principal Data Engineer,United States,"Principal Data Engineer, Wisetack, United States, Remote, Medical, Vision, Dental, 401(k), Hide job, You have a preferred skill badge, 1 week ago, 5 applicants","Company Overview

At Wisetack, we’re building financially-responsible consumer lending products that help service-based businesses thrive.

Wisetack is a well-funded :100 person startup founded in 2018 by a team of experienced fintech veterans, with a leadership team that comes from PayPal, LinkedIn, Lending Club, Affirm, Amazon, and other top companies. We’re backed by leading VCs, including Insight Partners, Greylock, and Bain Capital Ventures, (investors in Airbnb, LinkedIn, Instagram, Dropbox, and many more.)

We raised a $45M Series B last year and since then, we've invested in the team and the product and signed a slew of new partnerships. This is a fun stage in any company's lifecycle where we've got the core foundation built, a healthy growth rate, and a clear path to success, but you'd still be joining early enough to help shape the future of the company.

Business Insider called us one of the 70 most promising startups changing the world of finance , LendIt selected us as this year's winner in the Best Emerging Lending Platform category for their Fintech Industry Awards, and we were just named to the inaugural SMBTech 50 list (perhaps you saw us on the billboard in Times Square?) The external recognition is great, but we're equally -- if not more -- happy with the recognition from our customers. Our current NPS rating is a sky-high 78. We're proud that we're building a product that customers love and we believe that this is the most important foundation of a great company.

Learning and growth. We believe growth is a huge motivator. We want everyone on the team to have an opportunity to learn and grow in their career. If you are smart and want to learn, you should be with us even if you don't have all the skills we need at the moment.

Check out this post from our blog where we go into more detail about these principles.

We’re a Great Place to Work-Certified company!

The person in this role must be based in the United States and must be authorized to work in the US. Unfortunately, we are unable to offer visa sponsorship. SF Bay Area candidates can choose to work from our San Francisco office (whenever we return to an office) or from home most days. If remote, you should be able to come to San Francisco 4-6 times per year.

Benefits

We offer competitive salary and equity packages, as well as medical, dental, and vision insurance, a Learning & Development stipend, a 401k plan, and a growing number of other standard and not-so-standard benefits.

More than that, though, we offer a career-defining opportunity for the right candidate. Spend a little time on our About Us page , researching our team and our values, and check out our Press page and our blog for more background on who we are and what we do. If you think this might be a fit, we’d love to hear from you!

Our Remote Policy

For now and the near-term future, we are fully remote. We may have some sort of office setup within the next year, and that office will be located in San Francisco. When we do, SF-based employees will have the option to work from an office, if they so choose. That said, most roles at the company, including this one, can be fully remote within the US, and some contractor roles may be available outside the US. Our workforce is currently spread across 15 different US states, and 4 different countries.

Yes, we're still hiring!

We know that some tech companies face a difficult situation and have announced layoffs in response to changes in the venture funding market as well as broader economic pressures. Not Wisetack! Our business is doing incredibly well and growing at a fast pace. We also have plenty of capital, allowing us to continue adding key members to our team while remaining very prudent with our spending, as we always have."

About Us:

Braintree lets you move money from one place to another safely and securely. Every time you pay for an Uber ride, book a stay through Airbnb, or pay with PayPal when you check out online, you’re probably using our product. It sounds complex (and it is), but we make it so simple you can’t tell we’re there. We solve world-scale problems and provide opportunities to match. We build diverse teams that recognize our strengths and allow us to work on our weaknesses. You bring skills and a relentless focus on the customer, and we'll provide the support you need to do the best work of your life.

The Team:

Our focus is teaming with smart engineers who are passionate about their craft and excited to build software for our unique solutions in the space.

At Braintree, developers have the chance to work on various teams and stacks. Although most of our software is written in Ruby, we believe in using the best tool for the job. For example, we’ve written data platforms in Clojure, payment gateways in Java, and contextual commerce in Python. Here’s more:
Communication is key to our process, and we don't want to hinder it with walls. Many teams program in pairs, which means you always have another set of eyes to help you.
We practice test-driven development and believe that it helps us deliver simple solutions focused on real customer needs. We have no QA department – developers test, release and monitor their own code.
We keep the team in sync with daily stand-ups and have regular retrospectives to discuss things that are going well and opportunities for improvements.
We value unique perspectives brought by diverse backgrounds and experiences. A broad range of ideas and perspectives help us to create the best possible product.

We’re scaling fast at Zip (YC S2020)! Zip is tackling the $50B+TAM space to transform the way businesses manage spend. We started Zip because we saw the challenges companies had using outdated 20 year old software to manage hundreds of millions of dollars every year. We are a small but mighty team that helped scale category-defining companies like Airbnb, Facebook, Salesforce, Apple, Quora, Pinterest, and Square.

We graduated from YC as part of the S20 batch. We’ve raised $43 million in Series B funding – led by YC Continuity (Y Combinator) with participation from Tiger Global and CRV – bringing Zip’s valuation to $1.2 billion in 18 months.

Ability and interest to quickly learn new frameworks, architecture patterns, and programming languages as needed
Experience working at a small company with diverse responsibilities is a bonus, but not required.
Experience working with API connections with external systems like Jira, ServiceNow, Slack, etc is a bonus, but not required.

We have crafted an Applicant Handbook, which we highly recommend you check out, where you can find out more about the company, culture, how we recruit, what we do, and how we do it.

We are bold, like risks, and take on big challenges together. Our customers love the product, provide valuable feedback, and trust us to rapidly help them with more of their problems.

Feel free to join in one of our upcoming Townhalls on Clubhouse to experience it for yourself!

From humble beginnings as a niche tool with a limited set of features, Hospitable has grown into a market-leading solution for thousands of short-term rental hosts connecting hundreds of thousands of Airbnb, Vrbo, and Booking.com rentable properties.

We have no intention of slowing down. On the contrary, we are looking forward to accelerating our customer growth and releasing category defining products in the coming months and years. To do that, our technical strategy needs to continue maturing.

We were originally powered by a Slim-Laravel-jQuery mashup with job workers being called through exec('curl ...'); and more N+1 problems than we could count. We’ve changed a bit since then...

These days, our backend is powered by hundreds of Kubernetes pods, several databases that we now measure in terabytes, a separate Angular frontend codebase, and tooling to constantly monitor performance. All of that supported by a performance-optimised CI/CD pipeline with close to 5,000 feature tests.

As our software engineering team grows in headcount, our codebases grow in complexity, and our operational scale grows in RPS and QPS, we are looking for a Principal Software Engineer who will architect and lead Hospitable’s software engineering strategy.

Requirements

Hospitable.com is a remote-only and distributed company. For this position, your location is not a requirement. The ideal fit could work under European or American timezones.

What You Will Be Working On
Provide leadership to the software engineering team. Teach and mentor individual contributors toward engineering excellence.
Devise and own the technical roadmap that will allow Hospitable to scale 10x, while being able to ship code 2x faster.
Win buy-in from other software engineers for major architectural and code pattern decisions.
Shape the backend codebases and employed software patterns to create a delightful and intuitive experience for software engineers.
Write foundational code and design code blueprints that will be used for years to come.
Lower complications, make complexity more manageable and maximize flexibility while limiting layers of abstraction.
Identify, investigate, and qualify problem areas of the backend.

Why you will succeed

We are typically flexible with our requirements across our advertised roles. Here, however, we are quite clear on the type of profile that we are looking for. If you feel that you don’t cover one or more of the points below, be ready to challenge us on it passionately.
You know Laravel inside-out. This one is non-negotiable. We are all in on Laravel.
10+ years of hands-on backend software development.
At least one previous role where you had a major voice in software architecture decisions for high-scale, complex, customer-facing software in production.
Significant experience with queue/worker systems and database query performance.
Experience with creating approachable and easy-to-digest documentation, blueprints, and diagrams.
Sweating the details while also seeing the big picture.
A focus on shipping products at high velocity.
Excellent verbal and written communication; you can make complex concepts accessible with clear communication. We are a remote-first, fully distributed company. Strong written communication is paramount.
Great interpersonal skills; you can collaborate and thrive in productive and healthy debate with mutual respect and shared goals.
You leave ego and previous roles’ assumptions at the door. Every part of a codebase has a history, a chain of circumstances, and intentions.

Benefits

For us, the company itself is also a product, one that we iterate on.

We're always improving and creating an environment where we all love to work.
A supportive and caring team environment, where you are trusted, not managed.
Competitive compensation adapted to your location. For this role, the maximum cash compensation according to our salary grid is $253,968 (for a candidate based in high-cost-of-life city such as San Francisco or New York).
We want to offer options into the company equity through our $HOST token. When this can be implemented, the grant contemplated for this position would be $194,709 (not tied to location).
35 days off per year, encouraged (including self-serve public holidays) and parental leave.

Are you passionate about systems engineering and understand what it takes to build and operate memory-safe, resource-considerate, high-performance backend APIs in a distributed environment in Rust? If so, we’d love to talk to you about joining us in building next-generation GraphQL infrastructure.

With more and more GraphQL APIs being deployed by product teams in organizations, routing to distributed graphs with minimal latency is key to operating them at scale. In this role, you’ll have a critical impact in architecting and building infrastructure that graph operators with demanding workloads can deploy confidently into their production environments.

We have tier-1 backing from Andreessen Horowitz and Matrix Partners and our technology is used in production by some of today's largest and most innovative companies, including Airbnb, Netflix, Expedia, Peloton, DoorDash, The New York Times, Zillow and many more.

What You'll Do
Write and deliver fault-tolerant infrastructure code in Rust and read code written in other languages, like TypeScript and Java.
Lead, mentor and guide other engineers in architecting and writing code in idiomatic Rust.
Consult in architectural discussions that consider how to best operate and observe graph routing software in customer’s infrastructure stacks.
Communicate your ideas and designs clearly and up front, aligning with technical Product Managers on their designs and documenting them for end users.
Collaborate with other engineers across the organization and within our open source community using supportive communication and constructive code-reviews.

Who You Are
You understand operational expectations for running API infrastructure, including deployment strategies, optimization techniques, extensibility and observability needs and performance characteristics. It's a plus if you have a strong understanding of GraphQL.
You are knowledgeable in cloud and systems technologies, including both the architectural principles and the specific tools of the trade along with their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, Kubernetes knowledge is a plus.
Collaborating, mentoring and empowering others to do their best work is core to how you work.
You enjoy reviewing code, getting your code reviewed and seek feedback from your team early and often.
You're pragmatic and you know how to make tradeoffs between different designs in the pursuit of urgency. You optimize for overall business goals, not just immediate technical results.
You deliver. Shipping working software and seeing it in the hands of end users brings you great satisfaction.

We don’t expect anyone to meet 100% of these qualifications so we hope you’ll consider applying if this position sounds exciting to you!

This position can be done from anywhere within eastern US or European time zones.

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

The Data Science team at Intuitive works with business partners across the company. Our work is very iterative, very collegial, and requires outstanding communication skills. It requires a personality that is inquisitive and collaborative, and it requires someone who can communicate exceptionally well with non-data-scientists, often explaining things like P values or residual variance or other concepts that an executive must understand to see the value of the work. This person needs to be unafraid to lead discussions, based on their command of the data available.

Roles & Responsibilities
With the CFO, jointly identify avenues of research and deliver statistically rigorous insights in a timely fashion.
Develop a close working relationship with the CFO and the members of the Data Science team. Become a trusted and vital partner to the CFO.
Present and discuss findings to Finance and Sales leadership in a collaborative, iterative and sometimes unscripted environment, as well in more formal settings.
Deeply understand the customer journey for our varied customers. Understand the sale of $2M+ surgical systems, and of the consumables that work with them; understand the partnership between Intuitive Surgical and a surgeon as that surgeon decides to adopt the technology.
Collaborate with Sales, Marketing, Finance, and various other teams for cross domain analytics.
Build data foundations and develop models that attempt to explain, for example, variance in the adoption of Intuitive technology. Collaborate with (and sometimes guide) the CFO in developing testable hypotheses.
Develop statistically driven insights therefrom, that give finance leadership and others potent insights by which they better understand factors affecting our business, and from which they may modify their processes.
Apply advanced statistical and predictive modeling techniques to measure process effectiveness.
Create and automate powerful yet digestible visualizations to enable unaided consumption by business partners.
Build and help operationalize predictive models for internal use.
Identify gaps in data capture or data quality, and surface the value attached to filling those gaps.
Collaborate with fellow data scientists on our team.
Qualifications

Skills, Experience, Education, & Training:
Demonstrated ability to trust, and to be trusted. Unimpeachable character.
Demonstrated ability to think analytically and use sound judgment; capability to build solutions and solve problems while displaying excellent critical thinking.
Outstanding communication skills, both oral and written, appropriate for engaging deeply with our CFO and other executives, including presentation skills.
Ability to explain complicated statistical and data science concepts and metrics to executives and other non-data-scientists.
A personality that can handle engagement with top executives at a ten-thousand-person company. An ability to be succinct, and to summarize at the appropriate level. Knowledge and tact to contribute effectively to executive-level meetings.
Demonstrated track record of intellectual curiosity and initiative. Willingness and ability to provide guidance to business partners to “get to the testable hypothesis”. Demonstrated track record of “looking under rocks” and analyzing data in novel ways to get to hidden insights. A penchant for asking why, over and over again. A sense of wonder combined with the chops to get to the answer.
An interest and capacity to quickly learn the business of medical robotics through immersion in financial, clinical, and technical training – an interest and desire to learn this space are a must.
A natural affinity towards collaboration, and a willingness to do whatever it takes to solve the problem.
Strong knowledge of data science concepts (predictive modeling, regression analysis, control groups, etc.) applied to business problems. Strong knowledge of statistical methods and applications. Ability to understand cohort analysis beyond “averages”.
Proficiency with programming and data mining/visualization tools such as R, Python, Tableau, SQL, SAP HANA SQL, SAS/JMP, or SPSS. Tableau experience is strongly desired. Accuracy and attention to detail are essential.
Proven experience gaining command of rich and varied datasets, including incomplete or messy data, while making solutions repeatable and defensible.
Strong organizational skills. Ability to meet deadlines in a changing environment and perform multiple tasks effectively and concurrently. Self-management is important.
Ability to help choose, with the CFO, the balance between thoroughness and timeliness depending on external constraints.
Ability to assist in growing a small team over time, as needs warrant, to serve Finance more deeply.
Desired: A background in healthcare and familiarity with the business of surgery, specifically background in the surgical equipment sales process (large capital and/or consumables).
Desired: Experience or desire to eventually manage a small team of data scientists (beginning with a single direct report).
Desired: Familiarity with data generated by SalesForce.com.
Possession of a master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Operations Research, Data Science, or a related field with 3+ years in a similar role, or a bachelor’s degree with 5+ years.
Desire to make work fun.

Here at Hugging Face, we’re on a journey to advance good Machine Learning and make it more accessible. Along the way, we contribute to the development of technology for the better.

We have built the fastest-growing, open-source, library of pre-trained models in the world. With over 100M+ installs and 65K+ stars on GitHub, over 10 thousand companies are using HF technology in production, including leading AI organizations such as Google, Elastic, Salesforce, Algolia, and Grammarly.

Transformers in NLP pushed forward the computational requirements and the trend started to expand to other modalities such as Computer Vision and Speech which are actively adopting Transformer architectures to build the latest state-of-the-art models.

About The Role

Hugging Face has become the most popular, community-driven project for training, sharing, and deploying the most advanced machine learning models. Workload efficiency is key to our mission of democratizing state of the art and we are always looking to push the boundaries for faster, and more efficient ways to train and deploy models.

If you like digging into the dark side of low-level system integrations, compiler support, and framework optimizations: we should talk!

We are looking for talented people to join the Hugging Face Special Ops team, focusing on:
Bridging 🤗 transformers models with state-of-the-art AI hardware
Ensuring the above models meet the expected performance
Designing easy to use and proficient Developer Experience for our users
Deploying these models in the most efficient and scalable way.

This is an exciting opportunity to work at the edge of AI on both model architectures and hardware technologies! As additional material, you may want to take a look at the recent announcement about the collaboration with GraphCore on IPUs to get a better sense of what it means in practice 🤗.

About You

You’ll enjoy working in this team if you like digging into the dark side of low-level system integrations, compiler support, and framework optimizations. At the intersection of software engineering and machine learning, you would be in charge of integrating the latest features from our hardware partners in Python/C++, designing rich and easy Python APIs in the continuity of what Hugging Face did with transformers, tokenizers, and the datasets library with a strong focus on performances. Linux or embedded devices experience would be a great plus for the job.

More About Hugging Face

We are actively working to build a culture that values diversity, equity, and inclusivity. We are intentionally building a workplace where people feel respected and supported—regardless of who you are or where you come from. We believe this is foundational to building a great company and community.

Warp,Data Engineer,"New York, NY","Data Engineer, Warp, New York, NY, Medical, Vision, Dental, 401(k), Hide job, 3 days ago, 13 applicants","About Warp: The cloud-backed terminal for individuals and teams

Warp is modernizing the command line experience to make it more intuitive and collaborative for modern developers and teams, turning the terminal into a real platform to enable engineering workflows. Our mission is to elevate developer productivity, and the team is excited to have this opportunity to radically improve a tool that every developer uses and fundamentally change how software development and devops are done.

We are a company run by product-first builders, building a core product for all developers. We are committed to understanding our users deeply. We believe we will ultimately build the best product and business if that team includes developers and designers from a wide range of backgrounds. The early team comes from Google, Dropbox, Gem, LinkedIn, and Facebook. We are looking for passionate individuals to join us and help bring Warp to the world.

We value honesty, humility, and pragmatism, and our core product principle is focusing on the user. If you're interested in learning more about our company values and what our engineering team culture is like, please take a look at our internal How We Work guide.

We're very fortunate to be backed by a great group of venture capital firms. As of October 2021, we closed a $23M Series A, led by Dylan Field (Co-Founder and CEO, Figma). Other investors include Google Ventures, Neo, and Box Group, as well as a network of passionate angels, including Elad Gil (early investor in Airbnb, Pinterest, Stripe, and Square), Jeff Weiner (Executive Chairman and Ex-CEO, LinkedIn), and Marc Benioff (Founder and CEO, Salesforce).

The Product

Here's a quick demo showing some of our current features…

This is just the start, as our plan is to build out a set of experiences in the terminal that don't exist today like collaboration, environment sharing, rich data types and more.

The Opportunity

The terminal is one of very few tools used by every developer every day, which makes it an ideal gateway to improving all sorts of developer activities. We believe there is an opportunity to build a unicorn-sized business improving the command-line. Our strategy is bottom-up developer adoption, followed by driving revenue through enterprise sales and distribution partnerships.

To start, our goal is to become the everyday terminal of choice with individual users – immediately usable as a backwards-compatible terminal replacement with the developer's shell of choice. We have built a closed-source server, which will implement all of the cloud-enabled features. These features will invite users to share their work with others, driving growth and encouraging collaboration. We'll also focus on building a community and an ecosystem of terminal plugins and apps, creating network effects.

At higher levels of team penetration, we will offer an enterprise plan with features around privacy, security and environment management (e.g. secure distribution and management of API keys). These larger enterprise plans will be the ultimate driver of revenue, along with potential distribution deals for companies that see CLI integrations as a way to reach new customers.

A couple college students, totally unprompted, wrote a piece on why new students should work at Warp as part of their new newsletter they are launching called ""Why You Should Join."" It's an incredibly well researched and thoughtful article about the market and competitive landscape, and accurately reflects our thesis. Read it here.

Why this role?

We're hiring a Data Engineer to build our data infrastructure from the ground up, and help enable Warp to make data-driven decisions. You'll get to work on a fast moving project right from day one, and power the data behind every function at Warp, touching everything from: product, engineering, and marketing. Your goal is to set Warp up so every teammate can make better decisions based on data.

As our first Data hire, you'll be able to stand up data infrastructure from zero to one. You'll be foundational in establishing the company's culture around data. On top of working with engineers, you will also get to work closely with business functions like product and marketing, and sharpen your business acumen.

As a Data Engineer, these are the areas you'll get to drive…
Data Analysis
Segmenting customers based on behavior, channel, and company size
Finding factors that contribute to engagement and churn
Analyzing funnels in onboarding and activation
Warp is in the early phase of leveraging data to prioritize product work. We have dashboards that tell us the basics about usage, retention, and acquisition. With a much larger user base now, the number of insights we can draw has expanded. As the product becomes more complex, the need for insights has also grown.
We need someone to mine and translate these insights to better the product. You will be key in identifying and monitoring data insights that help to inform the product roadmap.
Some responsibilities include:
Data infrastructure and product
Build an experimentation platform and work with Product to execute growth experiments
Stand up our data stack: a data warehouse, an ETL tool, and a BI tool
Build infrastructure to ensure data is secured and conforms to compliance requirements
Warp's data stack is currently Segment, Amplitude, and Google Analytics. But as Warp approaches the next phase of growth, we can take advantage of the larger data set to drive product and marketing.
We need someone to build the next version of our data stack from the ground up.
Some strategic infrastructure projects might include:
In the future, there will also be opportunities to build data-centric features in the product, for example providing the user with CLI analytics, or making command suggestions more intelligent.
Growth
Building a system for monitoring product-qualified leads and surfacing them for Partnerships and Sales
Drive marketing decisions: measuring the effectiveness of channels, running A/B tests on copy on marketing and login pages, etc.
This is a role that spans all functions at Warp. You will get to leverage your business instincts to power Warp's growth.
Some responsibilities include:
You may be a good fit if...
You're experienced in engineering or data engineering
You have deep knowledge of SQL
You have experience working with data platforms like Segment, analytics tools like Amplitude and Looker, ETL like Stitch or Fivetran, data warehouses like Snowflake or BigQuery, and data pipeline tools like Kafka and Airflow
You're comfortable with building data products and infrastructure from 0 to 1
You have strong communication skills, and are able to explain complex data topics to a non-technical audience in simple ways
You're able to collaborate cross-functionally with product and engineering
You're comfortable with working through different stages of a company's growth and the corresponding data stacks
Bonus:
Worked on a product-led growth company or developer tools company before
Experience working with Marketing and Sales platforms like Salesforce and Customer.io
Familiar with GCP
At Warp, we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace. So if you're excited about this role, but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every qualification in this job description – we encourage you to apply anyways! We are a community of curious learners, and most of us are learning some skills for the first time (like our engineers learning to program Warp in Rust). You might be just the right candidate for this or other roles.

What We Offer
Competitive Salary & Equity – we will stretch to get the right talent on board
Full Medical, Dental and Vision Benefits
Flexible remote-first culture, with WeWork options in SF and an optional office space in NYC for folks who want to work together IRL
20-days of Paid Time Off

An SDE needs to communicate effectively to understand the requirements from stakeholders and end users. The candidate should be curious to learn new and complex technologies and also willing to train new team-mates on how the team’s software works.

Having experience on how the software lifecycle works will be critical as the SDE will be involved in designing and building all parts of the applications, including the front-end, API layer (business logic), back-end datastore, event-driven workflows, DevOps, monitoring & logging. Primary development will be done in Python & React. The candidate will also need to dive deep into other tools, frameworks and technologies.

The ideal candidate should be a self-starter, comfortable with ambiguity, able to think big (while paying careful attention to detail), exhibit excellent communication skills, enjoy working in a fast-paced environment and be able to stretch themselves beyond traditional SDE work (as this role will require such).

Mission: We're building predictive software to inform end-to-end inventory decisions for commerce brands and retailers. We believe that ML can empower 100x better decision-making, allowing people to not spend time on repeatable tasks but to focus on creative and strategic decisions. Better decisions around inventory mean drastically less overproduction and less waste (less textiles in our landfills ♻️).

Team: We're a cross-functional team, comprised of data scientists, product thinkers, software engineers, and business experts. Our team comes from Harvard, MIT, Google, McKinsey, BCG, Capital One, University of Cambridge, Bloomingdale's, TruSTAR, and VMware.

Backers: We're backed by 2 Silicon Valley VCs (1984 Ventures, Plug & Play), as well as (former) executives from Adidas, Salesforce, Reebok, Reformation, Demandware, Amazon, and Olivela.

Apply creative and quantitative skills when choosing loss functions / evaluation metrics ensuring direct business impact for customers. Manage metrics from multiple ongoing experiments e.g. Tensor Board or custom experiment management system).
Develop the product: Develop new product modules along the planning, merchandising, and sourcing workflows based on our inference engine.
Collaborate: Collaborate closely with technical leadership and the engineering team to make product design choices. Participate in code reviews with our team, as well as pair coding sessions.
Compensation, benefits and set-up: Competitive base pay, generous equity package, and benefits incl. medical / dental / vision. We have a “remote flex” policy, with our HQ in SoHo but team members from East Coast to Hawaii. We meet at least 1x per quarter in person: in March we’re flying the whole team out to Barcelona for 2 weeks.
🔧 Your ideal skills

Above all else, you are a continuous learner and are excited to add new skills to your toolbox. We believe that the best engineers can learn new skills on the job.
Experience: You have 3+ years of relevant experience as a data scientist or machine learning engineer in a fast-paced tech environment. Domain knowledge in retail / commerce / inventory / supply chain is nice to have.
Experience with forecasting and/or optimization: Experience with time series problems, predictive algorithms, and machine learning approaches to forecasting and/or experience with optimization algorithms, incl loss functions, constrained-optimization, Bayesian models, etc.
Hunger: You’re hungry to step up and take a large role within an early-stage venture.
Intuition: Strong, intuitive understanding of the underlying mechanics of common machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks.
Bigger picture: Understand the bigger picture: you don’t just build sophisticated models but can play a crucial role in choosing what we build and how we build it, and you can do so with ownership and independence.
Languages: Python with strong experience with common ML libraries such as scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Pandas, PyTorch, SQL, and/or statistical models.",5 months ago

Our large and growing ecosystem of technologies, services, and integrations is designed to bring the freedom and power of open source to our customers, which include Facebook, The New York Times, Salesforce, and hundreds more.

About the Role

The Customer Success Software Engineer role is responsible for ensuring our customers’ ultimate technical success in scaling, building, and deploying world-class applications on top of our powerful platform. In this diverse, customer-facing role, you will provide technical and architectural consulting and advice to customer teams and leadership; solve complex, often mission-critical problems with customer deployments and applications; promote platform knowledge and feature adoption to our customers; and propose, design, and build the tools and processes that power our business.

About The Team

We are first and foremost engineers, though our backgrounds and experiences in life and career vary. We typically have a deep background in either WordPress development itself (some of us are long time developers/contributors, experienced themers and plugin developers) and/or the web (others of us are devs with backgrounds in media or general technology.) All of us have a deep interest in code, learning and a commitment to open source, WordPress and the future of the open web.

We are also passionate advocates for our customers. We are unafraid of ambiguous or challenging situations involving code, humans or both.

About Facet

Facet powers visual storytelling at scale through creative and supportive AI. Create stunning visuals with our AI-driven, project-based photo editor. Designed from the ground up to rethink the process of photorealistic editing, Facet lets you edit, collaborate, and create in a brand new way. 'AI-driven' means that Facet sees a photo like you see a photo - as a picture instead of pixels - so you can edit intuitively. A project-based file structure means that when you edit one photo your edits apply instantaneously to your whole project - whether that's tens, hundreds, or thousands of photos. Bring stakeholders into your file to comment and collaborate simultaneously - or export your edits and apply them to a new project or share with a collaborator. Surf through styles and unlock new visual directions with non-destructive editing and an infinite history embedded within your layers. Whether you're an artist, content editor, or brand manager, Facet gives you the tools you need to streamline your process, so you can go wherever your creativity takes you.

Facet is being used by thousands of creatives around the world. You can see examples of their work on Instagram and Behance. Facet is backed by Accel Partners and a diverse group of designers, product thinkers, and AI luminaries from Google Brain, Salesforce, and FAIR.

Working with us

Consensus goals, independent execution. We value collaboration on goal setting and technical/company direction while giving individuals latitude and ownership over how these goals are achieved.

Decathlon, not a sprint. Creative AI is a rapidly blooming space, so we need to move quickly to build product and grow our market. We all juggle multiple roles and we're in it for the long haul. At the same time, we understand downtime is important. We don't have an explicit vacation policy, but unlike other startups we expect you to gauge your level of stress and take one when you need it.

Sane experimentation. We're exploring new territory and building a new product category. We need to experiment and try new things while maintaining a stable foundation for our future work. Our product should make the world better, and we shouldn't break anything we're not sure we can fix. Facet is partnering with artists and designers to develop a powerful, ethical approach to our technology, democratizing artistic expression in a safe, responsible way.

Creative + technical. Facet is about making technology a partner in the creative process. We enjoy product design, engineering, and research—but also photography, music, art, and cooking.

Diverse backgrounds. We're solving a completely new problem and need a diverse set of viewpoints and voices to fully understand its scope and extent. We're building a company and culture that can responsibly and respectfully integrate a plurality of voices.

Tea and baked goods. We're really into tea and baking & think these are good things.

Why join us?
AI for creative tools is something we at Facet believe very deeply in—as machine perception improves, we're truly at the cusp of a renaissance in new tools for visual artists.
Facet is something that has the potential to become a huge independent powerhouse, making creative work easier and more accessible for folks of all stripes, and we're the right team for this problem.
We are highly technical and we are backed by AI and product experts from Google Brain, Salesforce Metamind and FAIR. Joe founded two successful companies prior to Facet: Metamarkets was acquired by Snap and Premise has expanded to provide basic income and data services to underserved communities in over 30 different countries. Matt has deep expertise in computer graphics and machine learning, and previously led the engineering team at Operator.
As a member of the founding team, you'll have a significant influence on our product and we're top 1% in equity compensation for our early employees. We're going to make mistakes, we're going to write and rewrite a ton of code, and we're going to struggle with product direction and market development. We're being upfront because above all else we value honest communication and collaboration. There is no other way to successfully navigate a seed stage business.

Beyond a strong engineering, data storage/modeling, visualization, and front-end background, a successful candidate will have experience successfully leading teams, developing people, and building a scalable infrastructure. We are looking for someone that is a self-starter, someone that approaches complex business questions with data and curiosity, and a person that dives below the surface to identify the root cause and ""so what"" rather than just superficial trends.

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and we host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences.

Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance. Striking a healthy balance between your personal and professional life is crucial to your happiness and success here, which is why we aren’t focused on how many hours you spend at work or online.

Warp,Growth Engineer,"New York, NY","Growth Engineer, Warp, New York, NY, Medical, Vision, Dental, 401(k), Hide job, Your profile matches this job, 3 days ago, 5 applicants","About Warp: The cloud-backed terminal for individuals and teams

Warp is modernizing the command line experience to make it more intuitive and collaborative for modern developers and teams, turning the terminal into a real platform to enable engineering workflows. Our mission is to elevate developer productivity, and the team is excited to have this opportunity to radically improve a tool that every developer uses and fundamentally change how software development and devops are done.

We are a company run by product-first builders, building a core product for all developers. We are committed to understanding our users deeply. We believe we will ultimately build the best product and business if that team includes developers and designers from a wide range of backgrounds. The early team comes from Google, Dropbox, Gem, LinkedIn, and Facebook. We are looking for passionate individuals to join us and help bring Warp to the world.

We value honesty, humility, and pragmatism, and our core product principle is focusing on the user. If you're interested in learning more about our company values and what our engineering team culture is like, please take a look at our internal How We Work guide.

We're very fortunate to be backed by a great group of venture capital firms. As of October 2021, we closed a $23M Series A, led by Dylan Field (Co-Founder and CEO, Figma). Other investors include Google Ventures, Neo, and Box Group, as well as a network of passionate angels, including Elad Gil (early investor in Airbnb, Pinterest, Stripe, and Square), Jeff Weiner (Executive Chairman and Ex-CEO, LinkedIn), and Marc Benioff (Founder and CEO, Salesforce).

The Product

Here's a quick demo showing some of our current features…

This is just the start, as our plan is to build out a set of experiences in the terminal that don't exist today like collaboration, environment sharing, rich data types and more.

The Opportunity

The terminal is one of very few tools used by every developer every day, which makes it an ideal gateway to improving all sorts of developer activities. We believe there is an opportunity to build a unicorn-sized business improving the command-line. Our strategy is bottom-up developer adoption, followed by driving revenue through enterprise sales and distribution partnerships.

To start, our goal is to become the everyday terminal of choice with individual users – immediately usable as a backwards-compatible terminal replacement with the developer's shell of choice. We have built a closed-source server, which will implement all of the cloud-enabled features. These features will invite users to share their work with others, driving growth and encouraging collaboration. We'll also focus on building a community and an ecosystem of terminal plugins and apps, creating network effects.

At higher levels of team penetration, we will offer an enterprise plan with features around privacy, security and environment management (e.g. secure distribution and management of API keys). These larger enterprise plans will be the ultimate driver of revenue, along with potential distribution deals for companies that see CLI integrations as a way to reach new customers.

It's an incredibly well researched and thoughtful article about the market and competitive landscape, and accurately reflects our thesis. Read it here.

Why this role?

We're hiring a Growth Engineer to propel user growth through product-led-growth. You'll get to work on a fast moving project right from day one, and help lay the foundation for early monetization and sales. This is an opportunity to work on arguably the most important developer tool ever: the terminal. You will spread Warp to all developers from all backgrounds, and all software companies.

As a Growth Engineer, your job will be to help drive product-led growth. You will work with the Growth Lead to prioritize features that drive retention and engagement, and shape Warp towards becoming a viable team product. You will also build innovative projects that drive acquisition and enable the team to make data-driven decisions. You'll impact the whole user funnel from top to bottom: from acquisition, activation, retention, and engagement.

This is a hybrid role. You will spend roughly 50% of your time on growth/product, and roughly 50% of your time on engineering.

As a Growth Engineer, these are the areas you'll get to drive…
Retention & Engagement
Figure out how to increase week 1 retention
Measure the drop-offs in our onboarding funnel and list reasons for the drop-off
Propose our best-fit user persona through segmentation
Rank a list of game-changing features that will increase our product-market fit
Work with Support Engineers to create a product process for prioritizing the most important bugs reported each week
You will help shape the product roadmap, and ensure that our engineering team is building features that meaningfully lift up our user retention and engagement rates. You will conduct user research, conduct data analysis, and process written user feedback, to prioritize features.
Examples of projects you might take on:
Team Product
Figure out what the best-fit team and company is for the product
Design and implement a design partner program such that we get regular feedback during the product development process
Rank a list of pain points that teams face in collaborating with commands and the terminal
Conduct willingness-to-pay studies to figure out initial pricing plans
Instrument metrics that monitor the team product usage and revenue
You will help make Warp a viable team product that users use and teams want to pay for. You will interface with partner teams to help us iterate on the product. When the time comes, you will also help to figure out early monetization.
Examples of responsibilities include:
Growth Engineering
A feature that allows users to publish a link that replays terminal sessions in Warp
A web version of our Open AI command-search feature
Integrations into IDEs and other external tools
Marketing site revamps and experiments
Building an experimentation platform
Standing up and maintaining our data stack: a data warehouse, an ETL tool, and a BI tool
You will work with the Developer Advocates on boosting acquisition and building viral loops around the Warp app:
You will also help to manage the data pipeline. We currently use Segment and Amplitude. In the future, you might also take on infrastructure projects such as:
For the right candidate, additional responsibilities may include:
Building growth-related features in the Warp app, such as onboarding, referrals, team product, and telemetry
You may be a good fit if...
You're an experienced engineer familiar with Javascript on the front end
You're comfortable with building and maintaining dashboards using an analytics tool
You have experience working with data platforms like Segment, analytics tools like Amplitude and Looker, ETL like Stitch or Fivetran, data warehouses like Snowflake or BigQuery
You're excited to speak with users and advocate for their needs
You're able to collaborate cross-functionally with product and engineering
You're a strong written and verbal communicator
Bonus:
Experience with A/B tests and/or growth modeling
Prior experience in growth or developer tools
Strong eye for design
At Warp, we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace. So if you're excited about this role, but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every qualification in this job description – we encourage you to apply anyways! We are a community of curious learners, and most of us are learning some skills for the first time (like our engineers learning to program Warp in Rust). You might be just the right candidate for this or other roles.

Corporate Responsibility

For Capgemini, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) brings together our impact on three pillars: diversity, digital inclusion, and environmental sustainability. In North America, our key priorities are partnering with our clients and engaging our talent across these pillars. We drive success through these efforts by utilizing networks of employees with a common goal to lead as architects of positive futures.

Employee Resource Groups

Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are voluntary, employee-led centers of excellence for development, retention, engagement, recruiting and knowledge sharing. Collectively, they bring different perspectives with a focus to foster diversity and inclusion across North America.

Each ERG has a dynamic leadership team which work to make a positive impact for its members and Capgemini as a whole. ERG objectives are aligned with a concept referred to as the 4C’s: Career, Community, Culture, and Client. Activities planned by each ERG must connect with one or more of the 4C’s to ensure maximum benefit to Capgemini employees and our business.

Currently 18% of employees are involved in one or more ERG. In 2020, they have contributed over 21,000 hours of engagement.

Environmental Sustainability

Our Commitment

Capgemini recognizes that even though we do not manufacture products, the services we provide and business activities in which we are engaged can still impact the environment. We are therefore working to minimize our environmental impacts as part of our overall North America Corporate Social Responsibility program. We focus particularly on our major areas of impact: business travel, energy usage, and waste management. We are committed to identifying and complying with all local and international legal and other relevant requirements relating to our environmental impacts in Canada and the United States.

Our Approach

North America’s environmental sustainability approach is based upon three core principles: resourcefulness, impactfulness and accountability. The program focuses on reducing energy use in our offices and data centers, reducing our business travel emissions and reducing waste. Our drive to improve our own efficiency also generates innovative thinking, delivering operational improvements as well as cost reductions.

Our Approach Has Three Core Elements

We are resourceful - driving efficiency and innovation in our key impact areas of travel, energy and waste.

We are impactful - enabling our clients, suppliers and people to reduce their environmental impact.

Reddit is a community of communities where people can dive into anything through experiences built around their interests, hobbies, and passions. With more than 50 million people visiting 100,000+ communities daily, it is home to the most open and authentic conversations on the internet. From pets to parenting, skincare to stocks, there’s a community for everybody on Reddit. For more information, visit redditinc.com.

We are looking for a senior level Data Scientist to work with our Ads product team. You will partner closely with cross functional team leaders such as GPMs, EMs and leadership in utilizing data to drive decision making.

How You’ll Have Impact

Advertising is Reddit’s primary business model and we have an ambitious goal to turn it into a massive business. Although several large digital ad platforms already exist, advertisers are being increasingly drawn to Reddit because of our passionate communities that drive action. This large number of self-governed communities have highly-engaged users who are in an unduplicated mindset of consuming relevant information. This has created the opportunity for Reddit to build a massive and highly differentiated ads business.

As a data scientist on the ads data science team, you’ll be a key player in ensuring we make the right product decisions based on data insights and help define the culture that is driven through metrics and KPIs. Reddit sits in a unique place, where there are still a lot of low hanging fruit that will immediately impact millions of users and thousands of advertisers.

You will partner with colleagues who have a wealth of experience in online advertising and social networking industries. You will be an integral part of the growth of the Reddit Ads Platform by playing a key role in making data-driven recommendations. You’ll leverage petabytes of data full of user and advertiser interactions to develop a deeper understanding of Reddit’s ads ecosystem.

What You’ll Do
Build the metrics platform for the Reddit advertising business, including defining metrics, developing dashboards, building ETL processes, and establishing monitoring and alerts.
Help drive the bi-weekly operational review for Ads leadership team.
Conduct in-depth analyses across multiple dimensions to assess the health of the Reddit Ads marketplace and to help shape the strategic direction of Reddit Ads.
Work across all Reddit teams supporting the advertising business, including Product, Data Warehousing, Machine Learning, Sales, Finance, and Marketing.
Contribute actively to build up the knowledge base both within the Ads organization and the wider Data organization.

Who You Might Be
5+ years of experience in a data analytics or related quantitative role.
2+ years of experience in an advertising platform such as (but not limited to) Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Twitter Ads, or Pinterest Ads.
Understanding of experimentation and A/B testing principles.
Demonstrated ability to take ambiguous problems and solve them in a structured, hypothesis-driven, data-supported way.
Desire to mentor other data scientists and share best practices to elevate the data science practice at Reddit.
Strong ability to communicate and discuss complex topics with technical & non-technical audiences.

Waymo,"Data Scientist / Software Engineer, Planner","Mountain View, CA","Data Scientist / Software Engineer, Planner, Waymo, Mountain View, CA, $132K/yr - $184K/yr (LinkedIn est.), Hide job, 1 connection works here, 2 weeks ago","Waymo is an autonomous driving technology company with a mission to make it safe and easy for people and things to get where they’re going. Since our start as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, Waymo has been focused on building the World’s Most Experienced Driver in hopes of improving the world's access to mobility while saving thousands of lives now lost to traffic crashes. Our Waymo Driver powers Waymo One, our fully autonomous ride-hailing service, as well as Waymo Via, our trucking and local delivery service. To date, Waymo has driven over 20 million miles autonomously on public roads across 25 U.S. cities and conducted over 20 billion miles of simulation testing.

Software Engineering builds the brains of Waymo's fully autonomous driving technology. Our software allows the Waymo Driver to perceive the world around it, make the right decision for every situation, and deliver people safely to their destinations. We think deeply and solve complex technical challenges in areas like robotics, perception, decision-making and deep learning, while collaborating with hardware and systems engineers. If you’re a software engineer or researcher who’s curious and passionate about Level 4 autonomous driving, we'd like to meet you.

The Planner Evaluation team is working on one of the most challenging problems in autonomous driving: building algorithms to assess the safety and quality of our autonomous vehicles at scale. Evaluation at scale is of paramount importance in solving autonomous driving: the algorithms we build orient the development of planner software by defining the north star and thus enabling rapid iteration. Almost every improvement to Waymo’s planner is influenced by our work, indirectly (by providing the quality signals for onboard engineers to aim for) or directly (by incorporating our algorithms into our onboard motion planning code). This is no easy feat. As our self-driving car gets better and accumulates more miles, we need rigorous and intelligent methods to automatically assess whether a scene is risky, a maneuver causes discomfort, or an interaction with pedestrians or other drivers could be managed better. This can be done through geometric reasoning, simulation, machine learning, and/or modeling with statistical distributions. Developing evaluation algorithms in autonomous driving is an uncharted space and thus requires true ingenuity. If you are excited about leveraging a large volume of extremely rich data in an area with lots of unexplored territory to help the advent of autonomous driving technology, this is the place for you!

In This Hybrid Role, You Will
Develop signals to describe the quality of our self driving car's behavior, using a range of techniques including machine learning, statistics, math, and physics
Design creative uses of simulation to measure those signals
Work closely with statisticians, machine learning engineers, and roboticists to develop novel solutions to open problems
We'd Like You To Have
BS in Computer Science, Robotics, Statistics, Physics, Math or another quantitative area
3 years of industry experience
Python especially for modeling and/or statistical computing
Experience with tools for manipulating big data
Experience with machine learning or large scale statistical analysis
Problem-oriented mindset instead of only a solutions-oriented approach
It's Preferred If You Have
PhD in Computer Science, Robotics, Statistics, Physics, Math or another quantitative area
Comfort with writing production code in C++
Experience in robotics or with spatial data in another field
Note: The following is only applicable for roles hired in the US. As we keep the safety of our employees and our communities top of mind, COVID-19 vaccinations continue to be a critical prevention measure to help end the pandemic. Because of this, Waymo requires all US-based employees who perform work onsite for Waymo to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. If you are unable to be vaccinated, Waymo will provide a reasonable accommodation consistent with applicable law.

We appreciate your interest in Waymo. Waymo is an equal employment opportunity employer, committed to maintaining a supportive and inclusive workplace for all employees. Waymo does not discriminate against, and prohibits harassment of, any applicant or employee based on race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, national origin, age, disability, military status, genetic information or any other basis protected by applicable law.

We are looking for an entrepreneurial, thoughtful, and relentless executor who is passionate about applied data analytics and machine learning (ML). We build products that abstract complex semantics of data, so that our users can make use of the power of analytics and ML with minimal cognitive overhead. This requires careful thought, high creativity, and a deep understanding of data analytics and ML at scale.

You will be responsible for identifying adequate application of data analytics and ML techniques into Unit21’s products, and take full ownership of the development lifecycle of the feature. This includes, but is not limited to, framing product’s goal as a machine learning problem, designing data acquisition strategy, implementing data collection pipelines, researching adequate modeling techniques, prototyping modeling techniques, and integrating the models into product.

You should consider yourself as a Software Engineer who designs a production grade software of data analytics and ML, and writes code for it, rather than a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer, whose primary responsibility is to develop analysis and models. In the beginning, emphasis will be more on adequate problem framing for the product, data acquisitions and analysis; nevertheless, we anticipate emphasis will shift to production software engineering as projects mature, so we expect your foresight into ML in production even at an early stage.

What we're looking for

Expected
Ideal candidate for this role has experience in developing analytics and ML powered features as a part of consumer or enterprise products, from design to implementation.
Proficiency in one of the large-scale data processing frameworks; such as Scala, Apache Beam, Hadoop or Dask, or working with data lake using SQL or other data query languages.
Proficiency in one of the ML modeling frameworks, such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Familiarity with modern ML modeling techniques, and experience to have implemented one as a part of products or business processes in an enterprise setting.
Experience with developing distributed systems in production settings for data analytics and ML features, such as distributed data processing pipelines, distributed model training, and model serving.
Bonus Points (Preferred Qualifications)
Post-graduate degree (MS+) in machine learning, statistics, mathematics or similarly quantitative discipline.
Self-directed, thrives in ambiguity and willing to collaborate with cross-team.
Experience of building ETL off of databases (such as RDBMS, distributed datastore) and data warehouses (such as Snowflake, BigQuery).
Willingness to continue researching academic papers for state-of-the-art ML modeling techniques, especially in deep representation learning for semi and unsupervised settings and related areas, or experience to have published one.
Familiarity with MLOps techniques, such as continuous data acquisition, continuous model re-training and monitoring, and experience to have applied it to production, would be a strong plus.

How can we build the right human-in-the-loop operational system to scalably verify and enforce violation behaviors? What is the right balance between carrots (incentive mechanisms to reward good behavior) and stick (platform policy enforcement and penalty) to achieve the best outcome? How can we measure the impact of quality improvement on retailer trust and purchase behavior?

Our team already includes experienced Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers from Google, Uber, Airbnb, Square, Facebook, and Pinterest. Faire will soon be known as a top destination for data scientists and machine learning, and you will help take us there!

Strong execution programming skills
An excitement and willingness to learn new tools and techniques
Experience with relational databases and SQL
The ability to contribute to team strategy and to lead model development without supervision
Strong communication skills and the ability to work with others in a closely collaborative team environment
Highly recommended: Master’s or PhD in Computer Science, Statistics, or related STEM fields
Faire’s flexible work model aims to meet the needs of our diverse employee community by making work more flexible, connected, and inclusive. Depending on the role and needs of the team, Faire employees have the flexibility to choose how they work–whether that’s mainly in the office, remotely, or a mix of both.

Roles that list only a country in the location are eligible for fully remote work in that country or in- office work at a Faire office in that country, provided employees are located in the registered country/province/state. Roles with only a city location are eligible for in-office or hybrid office work in that city. Our talent team will work with candidates to determine what locations and roles are eligible for each option.

Why you’ll love working at Faire

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Job Description

As an MLE within the Measurement ML team, you will work collaboratively to apply novel machine learning algorithms and data science methods toward new products that empower our internal business stakeholders. The Measurement team quantifies the impact of Square’s business initiatives through machine learning models in areas such as marketing attribution modeling and forecasting value estimation. We empower stakeholders in marketing, finance, and strategy to make data-driven decisions that will help Square grow.

Measurement ML is part of the Decision Sciences team. We partner with business, product, operations, and engineering teams to guide better decisions using machine learning. We’re a passionate team of specialists, statisticians, and optimizers who are resourceful in distilling questions, wrangling data and driving impactful business decisions.

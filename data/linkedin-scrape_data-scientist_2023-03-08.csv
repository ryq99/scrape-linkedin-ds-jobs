Agoro Carbon Alliance US,"Data Scientist, Soil Carbon Modeling",Greater Chicago Area,"Data Scientist, Soil Carbon Modeling, Agoro Carbon Alliance US, Greater Chicago Area, Hybrid, Hide job, Promoted","About the job
We are reducing agriculture’s global greenhouse gas emissions to improve the world we live in!

Agoro Carbon Alliance addresses a key global problem, the impact of agriculture's global greenhouse gas emissions on our climate and the implementation of sustainable carbon capturing potential at the ranch and farm. Our passion lies in solving a global crisis by working with our customers to bring about the sustainable transformation of ranching and farming practices which is both economically viable for the grower and helps the world avoid a crisis.

A bit about the role:
Our team brings together knowledge in (geo-)statistics, agriculture, soil and carbon science, as well as applied data science to support Agoro’s monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) process of greenhouse gas emissions - with a primary focus on soil carbon sequestration.

As a Data Scientist - within our Carbon Science and analytics team, you will contribute to the development of robust carbon modelling approaches, in the context of the design and implementation of:
stratification approaches, for physical soil sampling purposes
a cost-effective monitoring approach of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, resulting from various sustainable management practices.

Your work will drive several aspects of Agoro’s core business, for instance:
assess soil sequestration potential and prioritize areas for business development
optimize carbon credit claims, by ensuring robustness and traceability of the “carbon journey”
decrease the cost of SOC quantification by the innovative combination of different approaches

Summary
You will combine your expertise in deploying existing carbon models, such as DayCent, DNDC, etc. with the use of other approaches, gradually including remote and proximal sensing data for carbon monitoring. To do that, you will work closely with remote sensing experts. You will be expected to leverage a wide range of datasets, going all the way from global climate data to local ranch or farm/field data. Your models will span across various ranges of spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. You’ll be expected to be able to handle these independently. Carbon crediting resulting from the implementation of sustainable management practices in farms and ranches, evolves in a rapidly changing “regulatory” framework. Your agility and eagerness to continuously suggest and develop innovative ideas will therefore be an important feature of your profile. You will be working with our data engineering team to build your prototypes to production and running on scale.

What you will be doing
The preferred candidate will support building and analyzing ecosystem model datasets, using state-of-the-art computing frameworks/algorithms to help calibrate/validation process-based models, and be able to tune your models efficiently.
You would primarily contribute to our current modeling effort, develop and implement algorithms that will help improve carbon simulation models and support measurement, reporting and verification of soil carbon stock changes and trace gas emission reductions.
You would be encouraged to innovate solutions for more efficient high-throughput processing of survey data into model inputs. The successful candidate will thrive on meeting challenges, insist on high quality deliverables, demonstrate effective problem-solving skills, and possess the ability to build productive external and internal relationships.
Collect, compile, and analyze datasets relevant for soil carbon modeling for agriculture and rangeland applications; build model inputs, analyze simulation results, identify possible issues if any and provide insight into simulated soil organic carbon dynamics.
Use specialized knowledge and current literature when identifying and implementing process improvement; bring academic research, technology and practical experience together to drive Agoro’s soil modeling strategy forward.
Rapidly prototype and iterate to build production ready solutions that scale.


What you will bring:
Bachelor’s degree required; MS/PhD in Agriculture/Environmental science/Soil science, or Applied Math, Statistics preferred.
Minimum of 3 years’ experience working with environmental, soil carbon modeling systems, or terrestrial modeling.
Expertise in working with relevant soil carbon models (e.g., DayCent, DNDC) is critical.
Knowledge of processes related to soil carbon sequestration and process-based models (i.e, DayCent, DNDC, APEX, SWAT-C etc.) and their requirements.
Excellent analytical skills to find solutions to meet business needs.
Ability to work effectively as a part of a team.
Strong intention to learn and contribute to the success of the team.
Highly proficient and experienced in scripting languages such as Python and R, statistical and modelling packages, and rapid prototyping, with ability to write clean, sharable and efficient code.
You are an effective communicator of technical concepts to both technical and non-technical resources.
Pragmatic, solution driven and technology agnostic. You focus on results, and get things done.
Prior agricultural experience is a plus, especially in a commercial context.
Fluent in English
Fluent in Portuguese is a plus, not required.

What will set you apart:
You have experience using Machine Learning in modeling frameworks.
You are competent at, and enjoy developing analytical solutions/tools, producing value-added datasets, writing up and reporting results.
You have experience developing process-based ecosystem models.
You have a solution-oriented mindset.

Why work with us?
We offer the opportunity to drive change by globally reducing carbon emissions while financially supporting growers.
You would be working with a globally dispersed and diverse team. We adopt a virtual-first approach, where we encourage face-to-face collaboration, but are focused on recruiting the best talent.
Support for personal development, learning and continuous learning is a priority.

Additional Information
As a global organization we actively strive to reflect the diversity in society. We therefore encourage all qualified applicants from all backgrounds to apply and are committed to creating a work environment that fits gender equality and allows combining career progress with the needs of a family or other personal circumstances.",

Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

Our Client:

Our client is a crypto-focused investment firm.

Our client is seeking a Data Scientist to join its investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. In this role, you will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data- driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody at our client to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self- starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

1-2 years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. At our client, we all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

If you do not meet these requirements, please do not apply. If you believe you do, please include a very short note / send a message along with your application describing your experience and skillset, with particular attention to your level of interest in crypto.

Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

Our Client:

Our client is a crypto-focused investment firm.

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. In this role, you will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data- driven insights into concise, well written reports.

Requirements

1-2 years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication

Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. At our client, we all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

If you do not meet these requirements, please do not apply. If you believe you do, please include a very short note / send a message along with your application describing your experience and skillset, with particular attention to your level of interest in crypto.

Our Client:

Our client is a crypto-focused investment firm.

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. In this role, you will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data- driven insights into concise, well written reports.

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

Our Client:

Our client is a crypto-focused investment firm.

Our client is seeking a Data Scientist to join its investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. In this role, you will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data- driven insights into concise, well written reports.

Requirements

1-2 years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. At our client, we all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

If you do not meet these requirements, please do not apply. If you believe you do, please include a very short note / send a message along with your application describing your experience and skillset, with particular attention to your level of interest in crypto.

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. In this role, you will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data- driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody at our client to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self- starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

1-2 years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. At our client, we all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

If you do not meet these requirements, please do not apply. If you believe you do, please include a very short note / send a message along with your application describing your experience and skillset, with particular attention to your level of interest in crypto.

Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

Our Client:

Our client is a crypto-focused investment firm.

Our client is seeking a Data Scientist to join its investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. In this role, you will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data- driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody at our client to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self- starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

1-2 years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. At our client, we all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

If you do not meet these requirements, please do not apply. If you believe you do, please include a very short note / send a message along with your application describing your experience and skillset, with particular attention to your level of interest in crypto.

Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

Our Client:

Our client is a crypto-focused investment firm.

Our client is seeking a Data Scientist to join its investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. In this role, you will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data- driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody at our client to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self- starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

1-2 years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. At our client, we all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

If you do not meet these requirements, please do not apply. If you believe you do, please include a very short note / send a message along with your application describing your experience and skillset, with particular attention to your level of interest in crypto.

Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

Our Client:

Our client is a crypto-focused investment firm.

Our client is seeking a Data Scientist to join its investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. In this role, you will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data- driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody at our client to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self- starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

1-2 years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. At our client, we all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

If you do not meet these requirements, please do not apply. If you believe you do, please include a very short note / send a message along with your application describing your experience and skillset, with particular attention to your level of interest in crypto.

Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

Our Client:

Our client is a crypto-focused investment firm.

Our client is seeking a Data Scientist to join its investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. In this role, you will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data- driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody at our client to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self- starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

1-2 years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. At our client, we all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

If you do not meet these requirements, please do not apply. If you believe you do, please include a very short note / send a message along with your application describing your experience and skillset, with particular attention to your level of interest in crypto.

About Infura

Infura is the leading infrastructure platform providing scalable and easy-to-use APIs and cloud solutions for blockchain and decentralized application developers. Infura currently offers APIs for Ethereum, IPFS, and other leading decentralized networks, allowing developers to immediately begin building instead of spending time on architecting and maintaining their own infrastructure.

Infura provides developers instant access to decentralized and blockchain networks without the need to sync or understand complicated peer to peer infrastructure. Similar to how one might access a cloud service to alleviate the friction of owning proprietary compute and storage, Infura lowers the barrier to entry for engineers to begin building.

We believe in a more equitable and decentralized future, and we know developers will be at the forefront of that progress. We want to empower developers to spend their time building, creating, and evolving by providing them with the best and easiest solution to their infrastructure needs.

Some things to know about the Infura team, we are a remote first company, with team members all over the world.

We depend on each other not only to make an amazing product but to be a group that wants to succeed together.

This role encompasses 2 sides of the data organization: the analysis side (including data science) and the engineering side. As an engineering lead, you will oversee the development and maintenance of a high quality data platform from which multiple stakeholders in the company can build their insights. As an analytics lead, you will help lead and structure the analysis of data into a collection of data products that foster an empowered / self-service data culture at Consensys. The role comprises three main areas of responsibility: the data roadmap, data governance, and engineering culture.

In managing the roadmap, the data lead will ensure that all commitments are reasonable and achievable. They will work with the analytics and engineering teams to sequence out and deliver all data products and analytics reports. Managing the governance of the data team involves establishing and maintaining the classification of all data managed by Infura, aligning with compliance requirements, and ensuring the data lifecycle is adhered to. Managing the engineering culture of the team will involve establishing and implementing best practices, incorporating principles of software engineering, and ensuring the continuity of engineering excellence within the data engineering team. The data lead will manage multiple stakeholder relationships both internal to Infura as well across the Consensys organization.

Would be great if you brought this to the role

You have at least 5-7 years of experience leading complex projects. You have 3-5 years of experience managing people. You have a deep understanding of servant leadership and have had success growing the skills of your past teams.

About Active Learning

In machine learning, data curation is only part of the battle to create a successful model. Once data is labeled, it is used to train, validate, and test models with the goal of production deployment. Upon validation, an engineer may discover a model may perform well at predicting one particular subset or class of data, but struggle on another.

The mission of the Active Learning team is to enable rapid model iteration with tooling and workflows to surface insights into model performance after completing the training process. We seek to give engineers the tools they need to validate models against ground truth data, spot model inaccuracies, identify gaps in cohorts of training data, and initiate workflows to improve that data for future model versions.

About The Role

As our MLOps engineer, you will be responsible for building our model inference and training infrastructure for both internal and external users. This includes model serving using Tensorflow Serving or TorchServe; performance optimization; monitoring, maintenance, and reporting; integration with labeling and data curation processes; development of generic training and inference services; as well as debugging and troubleshooting.

About You

Strong software engineering skills. Experience working with distributed systems.
You have experience designing microservices and data processing pipelines at scale.
Working machine learning knowledge of either LLMs or Video Models.
Ability to modify and train open source models.
Experience with optimizing models for production deployments (e.g. architecture modifications, quantization, or fusing layers).
Experience with distributed training and/or inference.
Previous experience deploying systems for efficient batch or online ETL.

Working with ConsenSys puts you at the forefront of an evolving paradigm, transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.

Blockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and we’re far from reaching our full potential. You’ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.

You’ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects — challenging you to stay at the top of your game.

About Infura

Infura is the leading infrastructure platform providing scalable and easy-to-use APIs and cloud solutions for blockchain and decentralized application developers. Infura currently offers APIs for Ethereum, IPFS, and other leading decentralized networks, allowing developers to immediately begin building instead of spending time on architecting and maintaining their own infrastructure.

Infura provides developers instant access to decentralized and blockchain networks without the need to sync or understand complicated peer to peer infrastructure. Similar to how one might access a cloud service to alleviate the friction of owning proprietary compute and storage, Infura lowers the barrier to entry for engineers to begin building.

We believe in a more equitable and decentralized future, and we know developers will be at the forefront of that progress. We want to empower developers to spend their time building, creating, and evolving by providing them with the best and easiest solution to their infrastructure needs.

Some things to know about the Infura team, we are a remote first company, with team members all over the world. We strive to reduce meetings, respect work life balance, promote diversity, and generally be good people. We depend on each other not only to make an amazing product but to be a group that wants to succeed together.

This is a leadership role so you will use your deep experience managing people to help grow our data talent and mature our data capabilities. This role encompasses 2 sides of the data organization: the analysis side (including data science) and the engineering side. As an engineering lead, you will oversee the development and maintenance of a high quality data platform from which multiple stakeholders in the company can build their insights. As an analytics lead, you will help lead and structure the analysis of data into a collection of data products that foster an empowered / self-service data culture at Consensys. The role comprises three main areas of responsibility: the data roadmap, data governance, and engineering culture.

In managing the roadmap, the data lead will ensure that all commitments are reasonable and achievable. They will work with the analytics and engineering teams to sequence out and deliver all data products and analytics reports. Managing the governance of the data team involves establishing and maintaining the classification of all data managed by Infura, aligning with compliance requirements, and ensuring the data lifecycle is adhered to. Managing the engineering culture of the team will involve establishing and implementing best practices, incorporating principles of software engineering, and ensuring the continuity of engineering excellence within the data engineering team. The data lead will manage multiple stakeholder relationships both internal to Infura as well across the Consensys organization.

Would be great if you brought this to the role

You have at least 5-7 years of experience leading complex projects. You have 3-5 years of experience managing people. You have a deep understanding of servant leadership and have had success growing the skills of your past teams. You come from an engineering background and have shaped the engineering culture of past teams. You have hands-on experience with systems in our data stack including Redshift, Airflow, EMR / Pyspark, streaming systems like Kinesis, and Data Lake implementations.

We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

Our Client:

Our client is a crypto-focused investment firm.

Our client is seeking a Data Scientist to join its investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. In this role, you will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data- driven insights into concise, well written reports.

Requirements

1-2 years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. At our client, we all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.

If you do not meet these requirements, please do not apply. If you believe you do, please include a very short note / send a message along with your application describing your experience and skillset, with particular attention to your level of interest in crypto.

Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

Our Client:

Our client is a crypto-focused investment firm.

Our client is seeking a Data Scientist to join its investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. In this role, you will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data- driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody at our client to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self- starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

1-2 years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. At our client, we all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

If you do not meet these requirements, please do not apply. If you believe you do, please include a very short note / send a message along with your application describing your experience and skillset, with particular attention to your level of interest in crypto.

About Anomalo

Data management solutions accounted for more than one-fifth of all enterprise infrastructure spend in 2021. The “modern data stack” promises a centralized data platform for powering valuable new applications, from AI-powered products to real-time analytics.

Unfortunately, a big problem stands in the way of most data projects and products – the issue of data quality. Rules-based data quality approaches that worked when data was small and tightly controlled don’t scale. And with more data sources, transformations, and users, quality issues are multiplying fast. The vast majority of issues go uncaught—until they lead to an expensive fire drill.

Anomalo is a SaaS solution that plugs directly into the modern data stack and automatically monitors tables for a wide range of data quality issues. Our software uses unsupervised learning to catch deep problems in the data, like sudden changes in the distribution, that aren’t covered by static rules or basic observability. With built-in root cause analysis, Anomalo shows not only whether data is anomalous but also why and what the impact is. This prevents data issues from reaching dashboards, reports, and products, while data teams spend less time debugging and more time building.

We’re rapidly growing and work with some of the biggest brands leveraging data today, like Block, Discover Financial Services, Buzzfeed, and Notion. The company has raised over $39M in seed and Series A funding backed by top-tier venture firms like Norwest Venture Partners, Foundation Capital, Two Sigma Ventures, and First Round Capital.

Anomalo is building the platform that data-driven companies need to be able to make good data-driven decisions, and would love to have you join for the ride.

The Data Platform team is responsible for the environment in which our ML and non-ML based quality checks operate. This means that it is a core product team - not a data aggregation/ETL/report generation team. The team owns the code that connects to all of the data sources Anomalo supports as well as any features built on top of those data sources such as table metadata aggregation or data lineage.

In addition to leading product for the Data Platform Team, the Senior Product Manager will work with the Applied ML team and Applications team to identify and prioritize features and enhancements related to our data platform.

The Senior Product Manager will also work closely with customer success, sales engineering, and product marketing to understand customer and prospect needs, launch and evangelize product features, and ensure that our data platform based products are meeting customer needs. The ideal candidate will have a strong technical background, with experience working in data-driven companies, as well as a proven track record of successful product management. They will also possess excellent communication and collaboration skills to work effectively with cross-functional teams.

What you'll do at Anomalo:

Develop a product roadmap for the data platform team and leading the engineering team in executing on that roadmap
Drive a customer-centric approach to product development, eliciting non-obvious customer needs, synthesizing research to gain a deep understanding and narrow definition of a problem
Collaborate closely with cross-functional teams, including engineering, design, and customer-facing teams, to ensure that products are developed and launched successfully
Deeply understand the technical constraints, user needs, and business requirements that shape the product, and leveraging this understanding to make informed decisions
Create a great team morale and work environment that fosters creativity, collaboration, and innovation

What you'll bring to the team:

4+ years of experience as a Product Manager or related data product role
Strong track record of shipping impactful products related to complex data-related workflows
Sense of urgency, ownership mindset, and data-driven decision making skills
Ability to go deep on technical topics within the data engineering space (i.e., data lake/data warehouse infrastructure, VPC deployments, etc.)
Excellent written and verbal communication skills, with an ability to clearly communicate goals, timelines, decisions, and tradeoffs to keep teams and stakeholders aligned
Ability to conduct user and market research and identify features to improve the product, and define and monitor feature metrics using data to recommend improvements.

Ideal candidates will also have:

Experience working at an enterprise B2B SaaS company
Ability to interface with technical external customers and articulate customer needs
Technical acumen, with a CS or technical background or experience working on a technical software product
Deep understanding of the technical landscape and markets (well versed in databases, data warehousing, data lakes, and familiarity with many of the data infrastructure products in industry)

Salary range:

The estimated annual salary range for this role is $190,000 - $240,000 plus meaningful equity

We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

From Our Client

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. The Data Scientist will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data driven insights into concise, well written reports.

Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. We all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.

About the Obama Foundation
At the Obama Foundation, we are guided by a core belief: that ordinary people working together can change history. Our mission is to inspire those people to take action, empower them to change their world for the better, and connect them so they can achieve more together than they can alone.
We were founded by community organizers, so when we seek change, we do it by bringing people together.
That approach begins at home, on the South Side of Chicago, where we are building the Obama Presidential Center. The Center represents a historic opportunity for Chicago: a chance to build a world-class museum and public gathering space that celebrates our nation’s first African American President and First Lady, steps away from where he began his career, where she was raised, and where—together—they made their home.
But that approach extends to all our work, whether it’s holding leadership training sessions in communities throughout the U.S., bringing local leaders together in countries around the world, working to support the global education of girls, or ensuring young men of color have pathways to opportunity.
As President Obama has said, “we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve them together.” So join us.
For more information, please visit www.obama.org.

Purpose of the Role
The Chicago Programs team is launching pilot programming that will begin to make connections for the future Obama Presidential Center.

Program Management: Execute program logistics for Hyde Park Academy Future Series. Serve as the primary program manager for the Local Lunchbox program. Support Obama Foundation’s leadership development programs including MBKA, GOA and other Chicago-based events.
Chicago Strategy: Refine and develop goals, metrics, and tactics to inform the Obama Foundation’s Chicago strategy. Revise the approach and strategy to be aligned to the Obama Foundation’s strategic vision.
Program Evaluation: Tracks program learnings and data to continuously improve programs. Identify metrics for reporting out on Chicago programs, collect and input data into Salesforce, regularly report out on data and progress.
Relationship Management: Coordinates meetings with partners and community organizations.
Internal Communications: Drafts regular communications for share out with Foundation staff and partners.

Key Deliverables / Outcomes
Health/Wellness programming, including healthy eating sessions at teaching kitchens on South and West Sides of the city
8-10 Futures Series sessions at Hyde Park Academy
Experiences in addition to the Futures Series’ conversations, including coordinating complementary conversations at the school, job shadow experiences and internships (in coordination with Foundation staff and Urban Alliance)
Arts/culture pilot program

Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

Our Client:

Our client is a crypto-focused investment firm.

Our client is seeking a Data Scientist to join its investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. In this role, you will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data- driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody at our client to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self- starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

1-2 years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. At our client, we all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

If you do not meet these requirements, please do not apply. If you believe you do, please include a very short note / send a message along with your application describing your experience and skillset, with particular attention to your level of interest in crypto.

Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

Our Client:

Our client is a crypto-focused investment firm.

Our client is seeking a Data Scientist to join its investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. In this role, you will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data- driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody at our client to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self- starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

1-2 years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. At our client, we all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

If you do not meet these requirements, please do not apply. If you believe you do, please include a very short note / send a message along with your application describing your experience and skillset, with particular attention to your level of interest in crypto.

Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

Our Client:

Our client is a crypto-focused investment firm.

Our client is seeking a Data Scientist to join its investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. In this role, you will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data- driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody at our client to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self- starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

1-2 years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. At our client, we all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

If you do not meet these requirements, please do not apply. If you believe you do, please include a very short note / send a message along with your application describing your experience and skillset, with particular attention to your level of interest in crypto.

Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

Our Client:

Our client is a crypto-focused investment firm.

Our client is seeking a Data Scientist to join its investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. In this role, you will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data- driven insights into concise, well written reports.

No unchecked egos. At our client, we all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

If you do not meet these requirements, please do not apply. If you believe you do, please include a very short note / send a message along with your application describing your experience and skillset, with particular attention to your level of interest in crypto.

We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

From Our Client

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. The Data Scientist will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Bachelors degree in a related field
3+ years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience

Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

Our Client:

Our client is a crypto-focused investment firm.

Our client is seeking a Data Scientist to join its investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. In this role, you will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data- driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody at our client to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self- starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

1-2 years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. At our client, we all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

If you do not meet these requirements, please do not apply. If you believe you do, please include a very short note / send a message along with your application describing your experience and skillset, with particular attention to your level of interest in crypto.

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea.

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

Our Client:

Our client is a crypto-focused investment firm.

Our client is seeking a Data Scientist to join its investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. In this role, you will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data- driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody at our client to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self- starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

1-2 years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. At our client, we all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

If you do not meet these requirements, please do not apply. If you believe you do, please include a very short note / send a message along with your application describing your experience and skillset, with particular attention to your level of interest in crypto.

Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

From Our Client

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. The Data Scientist will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

Bachelors degree in a related field
3+ years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. We all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.

Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

From Our Client

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. The Data Scientist will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

Bachelors degree in a related field
3+ years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. We all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

Our Client:

Our client is a crypto-focused investment firm.

Our client is seeking a Data Scientist to join its investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. In this role, you will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data- driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody at our client to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self- starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

1-2 years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. At our client, we all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

If you do not meet these requirements, please do not apply. If you believe you do, please include a very short note / send a message along with your application describing your experience and skillset, with particular attention to your level of interest in crypto.

Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

From Our Client

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. The Data Scientist will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

Bachelors degree in a related field
3+ years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. We all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

From Our Client

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. The Data Scientist will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

Bachelors degree in a related field
3+ years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. We all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

From Our Client

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. The Data Scientist will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

All of us at Linktree work either fully remote or a hybrid ""remote, but in-office sometimes"" approach and that will continue even when COVID is behind us.

We have several diversity and inclusion initiatives underway, including a D&I council, training for all staff on neurodiversity, unconscious bias, and the incorporation of a transpositive inclusion policy .
We prioritize our team's mental health, with all employees having free access to Headspace and Uprise , including 1:1 coaching sessions from qualified psychologists or counsellors.

The Linktree Story

We created and defined the “link in bio” category in 2016 to solve a common pain point for creators, brands and businesses: they had no way to consolidate their content and digital identities. The internet was becoming increasingly fragmented, so we launched a simple tool that allows anyone to manage their corner of the digital universe. We’re giving our users control of how the world discovers them – because why should you be defined by only one link?

Fast forward to 2022: Linktree is now used by some of the world’s biggest brands including TikTok, The LA Clippers, The UN Environmental Program, Manchester United, and Wear it Purple, as well as celebrities including Selena Gomez, Alicia Keys, Shawn Mendes, and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson.

With close to 40,000 signups per day (and no sign of stopping), we’re on a mission to empower anyone to curate and grow their digital universe – come join us for this ride!

P.S. If you don’t tick every box in this ad, please don’t rule yourself out just yet. We’ve seen the research that people from underrepresented backgrounds tend to only apply when the checklist is all ticks. We take pride in inclusion and hiring incredible human beings with great potential over ticking boxes – so if this role resonates with you, hit that apply button!

At Linktree, we celebrate and support everyone’s perspective and background, and we’re proud to be an equal opportunity workplace.

We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

From Our Client

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. The Data Scientist will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

Bachelors degree in a related field
3+ years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. We all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.

Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

From Our Client

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. The Data Scientist will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

The Linktree Story

We’re giving our users control of how the world discovers them – because why should you be defined by only one link?

Fast forward to 2022: Linktree is now used by some of the world’s biggest brands including TikTok, The LA Clippers, The UN Environmental Program, Manchester United, and Wear it Purple, as well as celebrities including Selena Gomez, Alicia Keys, Shawn Mendes, and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson.

Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

From Our Client

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. The Data Scientist will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

3+ years of experience in data science product analytics or business intelligence roles
Knowledge of analytics approaches - good foundational knowledge of statistics, A/B testing, experimental design, etc.
Experience clearly visualizing information and experimental results
Proficiency in Python, SQL
Sufficient familiarity with production data-processing pipelines to construct them working together with generalist infrastructure engineers; tools we use include EMR, Snowflake, Argo Workflows, S3, and Elasticsearch
Aptitude delivering technical projects via rapid iterative development
Excellent, proactive communication, both verbal and written
Masters/PhD in a technical field

Some example projects that you might work on include
Construct robust measures of product feature utilization and propose experiments/future avenues for product development
Recruit varied and disjoint data into a “North Star” metric for the performance of the Semgrep open-source tool over time
Develop models to deeply understand the product funnel and user churn
Run A/B tests to measure the impact of new product features

What We Offer

Our goal is to competitively and fairly compensate every r2cer with a system that equally rewards those who are vocal and those who are less comfortable making demands during the final steps of the hiring process. To that end, we generate internal compensation bands that are used when discussing and negotiating salaries. We update these based on market data to make sure they’re above the average for comparable roles.

We also invest in our employees’ well-being and long term success with comprehensive health plans, generous vacation time, learning stipends, and more. Our benefits are for everyone, so that you’re taken care of, and we work with individuals to make sure they have what they need, whether that’s quiet work space, adjusted hours, or any other accommodation.

The Linktree Story

We created and defined the “link in bio” category in 2016 to solve a common pain point for creators, brands and businesses: they had no way to consolidate their content and digital identities. The internet was becoming increasingly fragmented, so we launched a simple tool that allows anyone to manage their corner of the digital universe. We’re giving our users control of how the world discovers them – because why should you be defined by only one link?

Fast forward to 2022: Linktree is now used by some of the world’s biggest brands including TikTok, The LA Clippers, The UN Environmental Program, Manchester United, and Wear it Purple, as well as celebrities including Selena Gomez, Alicia Keys, Shawn Mendes, and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson.

With close to 40,000 signups per day (and no sign of stopping), we’re on a mission to empower anyone to curate and grow their digital universe – come join us for this ride!

P.S. If you don’t tick every box in this ad, please don’t rule yourself out just yet. We’ve seen the research that people from underrepresented backgrounds tend to only apply when the checklist is all ticks. We take pride in inclusion and hiring incredible human beings with great potential over ticking boxes – so if this role resonates with you, hit that apply button!

At Linktree, we celebrate and support everyone’s perspective and background, and we’re proud to be an equal opportunity workplace.

From Our Client

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data.

Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

From Our Client

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. The Data Scientist will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

Bachelors degree in a related field
3+ years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. We all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

Recursion is a publicly traded digital biology company industrializing drug discovery. Our team works on some of the hardest, most meaningful problems facing human health today. At Recursion, you will do some of the most impactful work of your life. Come join us in our mission to decode biology to radically improve lives.

What We Do

At Recursion we combine experimental biology, automation, and artificial intelligence to quickly and efficiently identify treatments for human diseases. Today we have four drugs in the clinic, and in the next 10 years we hope to discover 100 more. We are transforming drug discovery into a data science problem, and to do that we are building a platform for rapid biological experimentation, data generation, automated analysis, model training, and prediction.

THE IMPACT YOU’LL MAKE

Create a world-class research platform. You'll work with lab technicians, data scientists, biologists, and medicinal chemists to quickly derive insights from a large volume of raw machine-generated data .
Build relatability into a heterogeneous dataset. At Recursion, we generate datasets based on a wide swath of diverse biological models and treatment approaches. You'll work with Data Scientists to build relatability and queryability into these datasets so they can be used in five years to answer the sorts of questions we haven't even thought of asking yet.
Provide visibility into operations.

We Learn: Learning from the diverse perspectives of our fellow Recursionauts, and from failure, is an essential part of how we make progress.
We Deliver: We are unapologetic that our expectations for delivery are extraordinarily high. There is urgency to our existence: we sprint at maximum engagement, making time and space to recover.
Act Boldly with Integrity: No company changes the world or reinvents an industry without being bold. It must be balanced; not by timidity, but by doing the right thing even when no one is looking.
We are One Recursion: We operate with a 'company first, team second' mentality. Our success comes from working as one interdisciplinary team.

Recursion spends time and energy connecting every aspect of work to these values. They aren’t static, but regularly discussed and questioned because we make decisions rooted in those values in our day-to-day work. You can read more about our values and how we live them every day here .

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

From Our Client

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. The Data Scientist will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

Bachelors degree in a related field
3+ years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems

Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. We all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.

We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

From Our Client

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. The Data Scientist will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data driven insights into concise, well written reports.

Bachelors degree in a related field
3+ years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience

Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse

Create a world-class research platform. You'll work with lab technicians, data scientists, biologists, and medicinal chemists to quickly derive insights from a large volume of raw machine-generated data .
Build relatability into a heterogeneous dataset. At Recursion, we generate datasets based on a wide swath of diverse biological models and treatment approaches. You'll work with Data Scientists to build relatability and queryability into these datasets so they can be used in five years to answer the sorts of questions we haven't even thought of asking yet.
Provide visibility into operations. You'll create tools, dashboards, and metrics to help lab operations design and execute experiments, move and archive large quantities of biologically relevant data, grant early insight into the quality of proposed experiments, and track the provenance of key drug development decisions.
THE TEAM YOU'LL JOIN

The Automation & Information Management team develops tools and dashboards for exploration of laboratory instrumented biological data. This includes tracking and executing experiments, transmitting and archiving the resulting data, and running data analytics against all that we have discovered. This broad ownership makes this an ideal team for an analytics engineer who wants to create user-friendly processes spanning our laboratory and information systems. You will love this role if you have a background in biology with lab experience, such as bench work, automation engineering, or data collection and curation; or a background in software engineering with experience working with scientific professionals in a research setting.

What You’ll Need

Knowledge of at least one scripting language, such as Python
Experience writing queries and working with databases
Experience with data analysis software such as Splunk, Spotfire, Dotmatics, Matlab, or Jupyter notebooks
Experience being resourceful and collaborative in order to complete small projects
A people-first mindset. We work closely with people from a wide variety of professional and academic disciplines. Despite the deadlines, we always prioritize supporting our coworkers in their growth and experience.

The Values That We Hope You Share

We Care: We care about our drug candidates, our Recursionauts, their families, each other, our communities, the patients we aim to serve and their loved ones. We also care about our work.
We Learn: Learning from the diverse perspectives of our fellow Recursionauts, and from failure, is an essential part of how we make progress.
We Deliver: We are unapologetic that our expectations for delivery are extraordinarily high. There is urgency to our existence: we sprint at maximum engagement, making time and space to recover.
Act Boldly with Integrity: No company changes the world or reinvents an industry without being bold. It must be balanced; not by timidity, but by doing the right thing even when no one is looking.
We are One Recursion: We operate with a 'company first, team second' mentality. Our success comes from working as one interdisciplinary team.

Recursion spends time and energy connecting every aspect of work to these values. They aren’t static, but regularly discussed and questioned because we make decisions rooted in those values in our day-to-day work. You can read more about our values and how we live them every day here .

Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

From Our Client

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. The Data Scientist will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

Bachelors degree in a related field
3+ years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. We all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

The Linktree Story

We created and defined the “link in bio” category in 2016 to solve a common pain point for creators, brands and businesses: they had no way to consolidate their content and digital identities.

We’re giving our users control of how the world discovers them – because why should you be defined by only one link?

Fast forward to 2022: Linktree is now used by some of the world’s biggest brands including TikTok, The LA Clippers, The UN Environmental Program, Manchester United, and Wear it Purple, as well as celebrities including Selena Gomez, Alicia Keys, Shawn Mendes, and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson.

Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

From Our Client

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. The Data Scientist will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

From Our Client

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. The Data Scientist will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

3+ years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience

Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. We all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.

Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

From Our Client

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. The Data Scientist will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

Bachelors degree in a related field
3+ years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. We all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever.

The Roku Culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We’re independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

From Our Client

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:

Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions

The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. The Data Scientist will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.

There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data driven insights into concise, well written reports.

We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

Bachelors degree in a related field
3+ years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. We all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

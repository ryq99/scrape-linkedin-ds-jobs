We're on a mission to bring people the knowledge they need to make a difference in the world.

Glean was founded by a seasoned team of former Google search and Facebook engineers, who wondered why we don't have an easier way of finding what we need at work. In our personal lives, we have tools to help us find pretty much whatever we need. Why don't we have that at work? And that was the beginning of Glean.

Glean searches across all your company's apps to help you find exactly what you need and discover the things you should know. We're a diverse team of curious and creative people who want to help each other get big things done—so we can help other teams do the same.

Scratch's mission is to build a repayment platform to change the way consumers experience debt. Most of us take on debt to help us get ahead, or in many cases, to not fall behind. But for most of us—despite its necessity—once we have debt, it doesn't play a healthy role in our lives. It can be hard to understand, difficult to manage, and unaccommodating to changes in our lives.

This is why we started Scratch. We wanted to reinvent the loan servicing industry, well—from scratch. We wanted to create a world where debt plays a healthier and less taxing role in more people's lives. By bringing world-class product and technical thinking to a multi-trillion industry that hasn't seen innovation in well over two decades, Scratch's platform empowers borrowers to have greater control, visibility and flexibility over their financial health, removing the traditional loan servicer from the equation altogether and bringing borrowers closer to their lenders.

Our team is rapidly growing and comes from diverse backgrounds including Dropbox, Pinterest, Prosper, Bloomberg and Ripple. Our office is based in San Francisco.

With a rapidly growing community of lenders and borrowers, we think it's time the world knows there's a better way to pay back their loans. We'd love for you to join in our mission and help play a role in changing the way we experience debt for the better!

Scratch's mission is to reinvent the way that people experience their debt. Users can only understand their financial statuses fully when they can trust that their financial information is safe with us. Therefore, security is built into everything we do: product design, feature development, architecture, operations, and customer support. Our goal in security engineering is to provide delightful platform and product security. We strive to go above and beyond in protecting user data, implementing layered defenses, and making enforcement and compliance easy.

We're looking for engineers to work on all aspects of product security. Security work at Scratch is not just a matter of checking for common vulnerabilities or enforcing compliance with a checklist of best practices. We think through problems from first principles, and work with the whole company to design and deliver trustworthy systems that serve users and operators correctly in the face of hostile action. This means working at all levels of system building: product design, infrastructure, user experience, phishing and fraud prevention, attack vector analysis, and everything in between.

About the role:

Propose, design, build, and deploy security improvements across all aspects of Scratch's systems and product surface.
Research emerging threats and evolving best practices, and educate the rest of the team about your findings.
Work with our advisors and third party vendors on pen tests, security reports and compliance projects.
Think hard about the security implications of everything.

You may be a good fit if:

4+ years of industry experience in a highly regulated, frequently audited environment.
You have in-depth knowledge of security issues at many levels of the modern computing stack.
You have a well-developed mental toolkit for thinking adversarially and holistically about systems.
You excel at communicating analyses of technical issues and recommendations for addressing them.
You can make systems as well as break them; you're as comfortable building software as you are finding holes in it.
You're passionate about protecting both users and customers.

Benefits that we provide:

Health Care: We cover 99% of your healthcare premiums and 70% of your dependents premiums and offer competitive medical, dental, and vision insurance plans.
Retirement: We provide a company-sponsored 401k program!
Learning & Development: We offer a $1,500 per year stipend for your personal career development!
Wellness Benefit: We’re proud to provide employees a $100/month pre tax credit towards any gym or fitness program.

Generous PTO, sick leave, and parental leave.
Cell Phone Reimbursement: We reimburse you $50 per month towards your cell phone bill.
Additional Benefits: We offer each employee to enroll in tax free benefits such as commuter benefits and an FSA account.

Warp,Software Engineer,"New York, NY","Software Engineer, Warp, New York, NY, Remote, Medical, Vision, Dental, 401(k), Hide job, Your profile matches this job, 1 month ago","The cloud-backed terminal for individuals and teams

Warp is modernizing the command line experience to make it more intuitive and collaborative for modern developers and teams, turning the terminal into a real platform to enable engineering workflows. Our mission is to elevate developer productivity, and the team is excited to have this opportunity to radically improve a tool that every developer uses and fundamentally change how software development and devops are done.

We are looking for outstanding product-focused software engineers who want to work on re-imagining a product that we developers use every day.

🎥 Here's a quick 3-min video of Zach Lloyd, our founder and CEO, giving an overview of the product and the company: https://www.loom.com/share/b2824d2c8cd649faa466d6ca2a770939

As a Software Engineer, you will…
Have the chance to tackle difficult technical problems. One of the main reasons there has been little innovation in this space is that, for historical reasons, the terminal/shell division makes it hard to innovate.
Work on a fast moving project right from day one
Be a foundational member of our early team and shape company culture and long-term engineering practices

You may be a good fit if...
You are passionate about helping developers get more done — would jump at the chance to work on this particular product
You have amazing engineering chops, but are also product- and user-focused
You have great communication and collaboration skills
You're sensitive to developers' needs, and can develop warm relationships with developers
Bonus:
Building native apps in Rust or WASM
Shell or Linux-programming
OpenGL, WebG, or other graphics programming
Building open-source software
At Warp, we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace. So if you're excited about this role, but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every qualification in this job description – we encourage you to apply anyways! We are a community of curious learners, and most of us are learning some skills for the first time (like our engineers learning to program Warp in Rust). You might be just the right candidate for this or other roles.

Salary Transparency

Total compensation at Warp consists of two parts: 1) a competitive base salary, and most importantly, 2) meaningful equity.

When we find the right person, we try to put our best foot forward with an offer that excites you. We consider what you'd like to be paid, the skills and experience you bring, what similar jobs pay, and make sure there's equal pay for equal work among those you'll be working with. The budgeted compensation amount for this role is targeted at $145,000 - $205,000.

In addition to salary, all employees receive further compensation in the form of equity in the company. This is a meaningful stock option grant with a four-year vesting period and one-year cliff. Your equity is where most of the significant upside potential is. Comparing startup equity is always a bit tricky, so we're happy to walk you through different valuation scenarios at the offer stage in order to help paint a clearer picture of the upside.

Final total compensation is determined by multiple factors including your experience and expertise and may vary from the amounts listed above.

What We Offer
Competitive Salary & Meaningful Equity – we will stretch to get the right talent on board
Full Medical, Dental and Vision Benefits
Flexible remote-first culture, with optional WeWork in SF and an office space in NYC for folks who want to work together IRL
20-days of Paid Time Off
12 US Holidays
Twice-a-year company retreats
Monthly gym stipend
401(k)
Pre-Tax FSA Health Savings Plan
Complimentary OneMedical membership

Individuals seeking employment at Warp are considered without regards to race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex, marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, veteran status, gender identity, or sexual orientation.

About Warp

We are a company run by product-first builders, building a core product for all developers. We are committed to understanding our users deeply. We believe we will ultimately build the best product and business if that team includes developers and designers from a wide range of backgrounds. The early team comes from Google, Dropbox, Gem, LinkedIn, and Facebook. We are looking for passionate individuals to join us and help bring Warp to the world.

We value honesty, humility, and pragmatism, and our core product principle is focusing on the user. If you're interested in learning more about our company values and what our engineering team culture is like, please take a look at our internal How We Work guide.

We're very fortunate to be backed by a great group of venture capital firms. In October 2021, we closed a $17M Series A ($23M total raised), led by Dylan Field (Co-Founder and CEO, Figma). Other investors include Google Ventures, Neo, and Box Group, as well as a network of passionate angels, including Elad Gil (early investor in Airbnb, Pinterest, Stripe, and Square), Jeff Weiner (Executive Chairman and Ex-CEO, LinkedIn), and Marc Benioff (Founder and CEO, Salesforce).

The Product

Here's a quick demo showing some of our current features…

This is just the start, as our plan is to build out a set of experiences in the terminal that don't exist today like collaboration, environment sharing, rich data types and more.

The Opportunity

The terminal is one of very few tools used by every developer every day, which makes it an ideal gateway to improving all sorts of developer activities. We believe there is an opportunity to build a unicorn-sized business improving the command-line. Our strategy is bottom-up developer adoption, followed by driving revenue through enterprise sales and distribution partnerships.

To start, our goal is to become the everyday terminal of choice with individual users – immediately usable as a backwards-compatible terminal replacement with the developer's shell of choice. We have built a closed-source server, which will implement all of the cloud-enabled features. These features will invite users to share their work with others, driving growth and encouraging collaboration. We'll also focus on building a community and an ecosystem of terminal plugins and apps, creating network effects.

At higher levels of team penetration, we will offer an enterprise plan with features around privacy, security and environment management (e.g. secure distribution and management of API keys). These larger enterprise plans will be the ultimate driver of revenue, along with potential distribution deals for companies that see CLI integrations as a way to reach new customers.

FranklinCovey,Software Engineer - FranklinCovey Everywhere Team,"Salt Lake City, UT","Software Engineer - FranklinCovey Everywhere Team, FranklinCovey, Salt Lake City, UT, Remote, Hide job, 1 company alumnus works here, 3 days ago, 12 applicants","Job Description

Title: Software Engineer - FrankinCovey Everywhere Team

Reports to: Engineering Manager, FranklinCovey Everywhere

Location: Remote – Anywhere in the US or Canada



Job Summary

As a Software Engineer, you will build products to help organizations train their employees and overcome their most pressing people-related problems at scale. You will work with product, design, data, and content teams to build a modern learning platform, scaling usage (and impact) 10-100x in the next year.

Role Context

Historically, FranklinCovey primarily offered in-person, one-off training. Over the last five years we have made substantial investments, and have had significant success, transitioning the business to an online, subscription product: All Access Pass. Last year we acquired Strive, an edTech startup whose leadership development platform was used by leading tech companies like Slack, Airbnb, Pinterest and Intuit. Under the Strive team’s direction and leadership, we are doubling down on their technology/product-centric approach and looking to build out a larger product and engineering team.



Essential Job Functions
Ideate: Engineers participate early in the product development process. You will review regular quantitative and qualitative research about our clients and learners and weigh in on the product strategy and roadmap.
Collaborate: You will partner with product, data and design to define the product features and functionality to ensure we're building the right thing at the right time and in the right way.
Build: You will ship regularly and iteratively, writing testable, readable and maintainable code.
Review & Architect: As a Software Engineer you will play a leadership role in code reviews for the team, helping set the engineer bar, defining best practices, and weighing in on major architecture decisions.
Support: You will work with the sales, marketing, implementation and support teams to ensure users get the most value from the products you've built.

Job Requirements
Experience building and shipping high-quality products (years of experience ≠ ability, this is a proxy but not a hard requirement)
Front-end experience with React, TypeScript and CSS required. Back-end experience required, Python/Django preferred. We're looking for great engineers and are confident that you can learn the language with time and direction.
Drive to continually improve and share knowledge with your teammates.
Ability and experience mentoring/guiding/developing more junior engineers with code reviews, best practice sharing, and architecture decisions
Experience architecting or refactoring systems of moderate complexity.
Experience with performance, security, privacy, accessibility, and localization/globalization preferred but not required.

Why We Think This is a Great Opportunity
Interesting Product, Technical and Organizational Challenges – This year we will increase the number of users on Strive's learning platform 100 to 1000x. This will require us to solve a number of interesting product, technical and organizational challenges – whatever your unique interest is, there's likely a good challenge for you to work on.
Impact at Scale – FranklinCovey positively impacts the lives of millions of learners and tens of millions of their direct reports every year – FC directly teaches 4x as many learners in the US as all US business schools combined! By building out platform integrations for learning and planning in the flow of work, you'll substantially increase the quality of the learning experience and thus improve the skills and experiences of that enormous audience.
Startup Speed, Established Company Security – FranklinCovey's product & tech org is small relative to the company's learner/client scale, so you'll be able to move quickly to build a strategy and ship great products. Unlike a startup, FC is an established (and profitable!) publicly traded company, so you won't worry about the next funding round falling through and a lack of job security.

Job Title: Senior Software Engineer

Reports to: Senior Director of Engineering

Location: Anywhere in the USA, Canada or Latin America

FranklinCovey Summary

Franklin Covey Co. (NYSE: FC) is one of the world's largest leadership companies with 1,000 employees, 1,500 clients and 2,000,000+ learners. We help organizations achieve greatness on the four people-related challenges that matter most: leadership, individual effectiveness, culture and business processes. Our unique approach combines content, technology and people to generate collective behavior change at scale. Our core product, the FranklinCovey All Access Pass®, provides companies access to 20+ courses in multiple modalities and in >20 languages. The All Access Pass has grown from $0 to $100MM in recurring revenue in the last five years, making it among the fastest growing products in edtech.

Role Context

Historically FC primarily offered in-person, one-off training. Over the last five years we have made substantial investments, and have had significant success, transitioning the business to an online, subscription product (AAP). In April ‘21 we acquired Strive, an edtech startup whose leadership development platform was used by leading tech cos like Slack, Airbnb, Pinterest and Intuit. Under the Strive's team direction and leadership, we are doubling down on the technology/product-centric approach and looking to build out a larger product and engineering team.

Role Summary

As a Senior Software Engineer, you will build products to help organizations train their employees and overcome their most pressing people-related problems at scale. You will work with product, design, data, and content teams to build a modern learning platform, scaling usage (and impact) 10-100x in the next year.

Core Job Responsibilities
Ideate: Engineers participate early in the product development process. You will review regular quantitative and qualitative research about our clients and learners and weigh in on the product strategy and roadmap.
Collaborate: You will partner with product, data and design to define the product features and functionality to ensure we're building the right thing at the right time and in the right way.
Build: You will ship regularly and iteratively, writing testable, readable and maintainable code.
Review & Architect: As a Senior Software Engineer you will play a leadership role in code reviews for the team, helping set the engineer bar, defining best practices, and weighing in on major architecture decisions.
Support: You will work with the sales, marketing, implementation and support teams to ensure users get the most value from the products you've built.

Job Requirements
5-10 years of experience building and shipping high-quality products (years of experience ≠ ability, so we'll use this as a proxy but not a hard requirement).
Back-end experience with Node.js, Python (Django), or Ruby on Rails and front-end experience with React preferred but not required. We're looking for great engineers and are confident that you can learn the language with time and direction.
Drive to continually improve and share knowledge with your teammates.
Ability and experience mentoring/guiding/developing more junior engineers with code reviews, best practice sharing, and architecture decisions.
Experience with performance, security, privacy, accessibility, and localization/globalization preferred but not required.
Experience architecting or refactoring systems of moderate complexity preferred but not required.

Why We Think This is a Great Opportunity
Interesting Product, Technical and Organizational Challenges – This year we will increase the number of users on Strive's learning platform 100 to 1000x. This will require us to solve a number of interesting product, technical and organizational challenges – whatever your unique interest is, there's likely a good challenge for you to work on.
Impact at Scale – FranklinCovey positively impacts the lives of millions of learners and tens of millions of their direct reports every year – FC directly teaches 4x as many learners in the US as all US business schools combined! By building out platform integrations for learning and planning in the flow of work, you'll substantially increase the quality of the learning experience and thus improve the skills and experiences of that enormous audience.
Startup Speed, Established Company Security – FranklinCovey's product & tech org is small relative to the company's learner/client scale, so you'll be able to move quickly to build a strategy and ship great products. Unlike a startup, FC is an established (and profitable!) publicly traded company, so you won't worry about the next funding round falling through and a lack of job security.

Company Information

Franklin Covey Co. (NYSE: FC) is a global, public company, specializing in organizational performance improvement. We help organizations achieve results that require lasting changes in human behavior. Our world-class solutions enable greatness in individuals, teams and organizations and are accessible through the FranklinCovey All Access Pass® available in multiple modalities and in 21 languages.

We’re building the infrastructure and tools for future-thinking brands + consumers. Authentic enables brands to create powerful post-purchase experiences that onboard their customers, increase retention, and drive repeat purchases. Our platform empowers consumers to protect the products they value most with our vault and incoming embedded insurance tools.

Strong post-purchase experiences have never been more important for consumer brands. As GenZ and GenAlpha (that’s a real thing, we promise) become core consumers and their purchasing power increases, the way brands sell products and interact with their customers will drastically change.

Our first product enables luxury brands to create and attach secure certificates of authenticity (COAs) to each purchase. We integrate into the point-of-sale to generate digital records that secure documents, simplify asset ownership, automate financial services, manage provenance, and decrease fraud.

We’ve raised $2 million from Stellation Capital, Penske Media (owns Rolling Stone, Robb Report, Variety), Gaingels, Ligature, Gokul Rajaram (board member at Coinbase & Pinterest), and a stellar group of strategic, value-add angel investors. Our customers include The Clear Cut, Kwiat, and KNOPF Watches. Over the last year, we’ve been mentioned in Forbes, Fast Company, JCK, Entrepreneur, Retail Bum, and Gotham Mag.

We’re growing our world-class engineering team to build solutions for billions of consumers worldwide.

The Role
As a Senior Software Engineer and an early team member, you will help shape the engineering team at Authentic. You’ll work alongside product, design, and sales teams to transform our initial product into a robust and scalable platform. You’ll love this role if you’re excited about building fast and having a lot of ownership. The business is growing quickly, and this role will be central to our continued expansion and our ability to make a big impact on the world.

This role is remote-eligible!

At Authentic you will:
Work with our founder and other engineers to make decisions on our product, architecture, UX, etc.
Implement effective engineering practices and processes: deployment cycles, code reviews, automated testing, and more.
Collaborate with product managers and designers on our roadmap and execute your team's goals in a timely and efficient manner.
Contribute to system design & architectural decisions to support the adoption and continued success of Authentic’s product.
Learn from customer needs (watch customer call recordings, chat with customers on Slack/email, and occasionally jump on video calls).

You will be a good fit if:
You have 3+ years of experience as a software engineer (or other relevant experiences) and you have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field, equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience.
You're excited to explain complex technical concepts and share your knowledge with diverse audiences both internally and externally.
You possess outstanding written and verbal communication skills, with the ability to go a mile deep with technical customer resources or to explain the most basic capabilities to a business user.
You’re comfortable with uncertainty and fast-paced, high-growth environments. You adapt quickly and you feel an inherent need to grow and learn.
You don't shy away from performance conversations and you recognize the relationship between objective feedback and career growth.

AUTHENTIC,Sr Software Engineer,"New York, NY","Sr Software Engineer, AUTHENTIC, New York, NY, On-site, $130K/yr - $185K/yr, Hide job, 2 weeks ago, 2 applicants","About Authentic

We’re building the infrastructure and tools for future-thinking brands + consumers. Authentic enables brands to create powerful post-purchase experiences that onboard their customers, increase retention, and drive repeat purchases. Our platform empowers consumers to protect the products they value most with our vault and incoming embedded insurance tools.

Strong post-purchase experiences have never been more important for consumer brands. As GenZ and GenAlpha (that’s a real thing, we promise) become core consumers and their purchasing power increases, the way brands sell products to and interact with their customers will drastically change.

Our first product enables luxury brands to create and attach secure certificates of authenticity (COAs) to each purchase. We integrate into the point-of-sale to generate digital records that secure documents, simplify asset ownership, automate financial services, manage provenance, and decrease fraud.

We’ve raised $2 million from Stellation Capital, Penske Media (owns Rolling Stone, Robb Report, Variety), Gaingels, Ligature, Gokul Rajaram (board member at Coinbase & Pinterest), and a stellar group of strategic, value-add angel investors. Our customers include The Clear Cut, Kwiat, and KNOPF Watches. Over the last year, we’ve been mentioned in Forbes, Fast Company, JCK, Entrepreneur, Retail Bum, and Gotham Mag.

We’re growing our world-class engineering team to build solutions for billions of consumers worldwide.

The Role

As a Senior Software Engineer and an early team member, you will help shape the engineering team at Authentic. You’ll work alongside product, design, and sales teams to transform our initial product into a robust and scalable platform. You’ll love this role if you’re excited about building fast and having a lot of ownership. The business is growing quickly, and this role will be central to our continued expansion and our ability to make a big impact on the world.

This role is remote-eligible!

**
At Authentic you will:
Work with our founder and other engineers to make decisions on our product, architecture, UX, etc.
Implement effective engineering practices and processes: deployment cycles, code reviews, automated testing, and more.
Collaborate with product managers and designers on our roadmap and execute your team's goals in a timely and efficient manner.
Contribute to system design & architectural decisions to support the adoption and continued success of Authentic’s product.
Learn from customer needs (watch customer call recordings, chat with customers on Slack/email, and occasionally jump on video calls).
You Will Be a Good Fit If
You have 3+ years of experience as a software engineer (or other relevant experiences) and you have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field, equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience.
You're excited to explain complex technical concepts and share your knowledge with diverse audiences both internally and externally.
You possess outstanding written and verbal communication skills, with the ability to go a mile deep with technical customer resources or to explain the most basic capabilities to a business user.
You’re comfortable with uncertainty and fast-paced, high-growth environments. You adapt quickly and you feel an inherent need to grow and learn.
You don't shy away from performance conversations and you recognize the relationship between objective feedback and career growth.

Scratch's mission is to build a repayment platform to change the way consumers experience debt. Most of us take on debt to help us get ahead, or in many cases, to not fall behind. But for most of us—despite its necessity—once we have debt, it doesn't play a healthy role in our lives. It can be hard to understand, difficult to manage, and unaccommodating to changes in our lives.

This is why we started Scratch. We wanted to reinvent the loan servicing industry, well—from scratch. We wanted to create a world where debt plays a healthier and less taxing role in more people's lives. By bringing world-class product and technical thinking to a multi-trillion industry that hasn't seen innovation in well over two decades, Scratch's platform empowers borrowers to have greater control, visibility and flexibility over their financial health, removing the traditional loan servicer from the equation altogether and bringing borrowers closer to their lenders.

Our team is rapidly growing and comes from diverse backgrounds including Dropbox, Pinterest, Prosper, Bloomberg and Ripple. Our office is based in San Francisco.

With a rapidly growing community of lenders and borrowers, we think it's time the world knows there's a better way to pay back their loans. We'd love for you to join in our mission and help play a role in changing the way we experience debt for the better!

At Scratch we aspire to truly empower both borrowers and lenders to take charge of their financial health and we recognize that secure and scalable infrastructure is crucial to doing it. As a software engineer building the next generation of Scratch’s technical infrastructure, you’ll create and scale systems that are the source of truth for billions of dollars.

In this role you’ll work with your team to design and build the shared infrastructure that other engineers use in their every day development. You’ll leverage in-house libraries, open source tools, and AWS to help create a reliable cloud platform that powers the overall Scratch platform. The systems you and your team will put in place will shape the future of loan servicing and debt.

About the role:

Design, build, and scale the cloud platform that other engineers use in their every day development
Create shared infrastructure for deployment, logging, monitoring, authorization, data storage, and more
Solve the complex challenges of building reliable asynchronous, eventually consistent systems
Participate in design reviews and code reviews
Work with other teams and leads to build and ship infrastructure to power core Scratch product features

You may be a good fit if:

You have experience creating and scaling a microservice based architecture using containers
You have worked on systems running on AWS or another cloud provider
You have a passion for building shared infrastructure used by others
You have experience in databases, distributed systems, and backend performance measurement and optimization
You have worked on or are interested in open source technologies such as docker, protocol buffers, gRPC, Twirp, or Prometheus

Benefits that we provide:

Health Care: We cover 99% of your healthcare premiums and 70% of your dependents premiums and offer competitive medical, dental, and vision insurance plans.
Retirement: We provide a company-sponsored 401k program!

Wellness Benefit: We’re proud to provide employees a $100/month pre tax credit towards any gym or fitness program.

Scratch's mission is to build a repayment platform to change the way consumers experience debt. Most of us take on debt to help us get ahead, or in many cases, to not fall behind. But for most of us—despite its necessity—once we have debt, it doesn't play a healthy role in our lives. It can be hard to understand, difficult to manage, and unaccommodating to changes in our lives.

This is why we started Scratch. We wanted to reinvent the loan servicing industry, well—from scratch. We wanted to create a world where debt plays a healthier and less taxing role in more people's lives. By bringing world-class product and technical thinking to a multi-trillion industry that hasn't seen innovation in well over two decades, Scratch's platform empowers borrowers to have greater control, visibility and flexibility over their financial health, removing the traditional loan servicer from the equation altogether and bringing borrowers closer to their lenders.

Our team is rapidly growing and comes from diverse backgrounds including Dropbox, Pinterest, Prosper, Bloomberg and Ripple. Our office is based in San Francisco.

With a rapidly growing community of lenders and borrowers, we think it's time the world knows there's a better way to pay back their loans. We'd love for you to join in our mission and help play a role in changing the way we experience debt for the better!

Scratch’s backend presents many interesting challenges and opportunities for designing and architecting complex systems. You and your team will work on high-stakes engineering challenges that will shape the future of loan servicing and debt. What's at stake? Scratch aims to be the source of truth for trillions of dollars. It's crucial that our novel platform ensures accuracy and precision on non-trivial math down to seven decimal places with zero data loss or security compromises, resiliency to handle a large number of loans at scale as well as the flexibility to handle new and innovative financial instruments.

About the role:

Architect and scale complex systems like our loan servicing engine and time-series database.
Design core pieces of Scratch’s infrastructure, optimizing for long-term maintainability, performance, and reliability.
Build and scale systems for monitoring, tracing, profiling, debugging, and deploying.
Take full ownership and responsibility for building, shipping, and maintaining core Scratch features, end-to-end.

You may be a good fit if:

6+ years industry experience You have experience in databases, distributed systems, and backend performance measurement and optimization.
You have experience leading engineering projects.
You derive joy from refactoring and abstracting in order to make complex systems fun to develop on and easy to understand.
You have a strong background in computer science and mathematics.

We want you!

If you made it this far, chances are you’re as excited about working to change how people experience debt as we are—and we love that. Please apply even if you’re unsure about whether you meet every single requirement in this posting. Scratch is looking for smart, intellectually curious people who are invested in our mission, not just those who can “check all the boxes”.

Benefits we Provide:

Health insurance: We cover 99% of your healthcare premiums and 70% of your dependent’s premiums and offer competitive medical, dental, and vision insurance plans.

Learning and development stipend: We offer a $1,500 per year stipend for your personal career development!

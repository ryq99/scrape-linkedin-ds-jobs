Learn more about our flexible approach to where we work.

Overview

The Fulfillment Marketplace system sits at the core of Instacart. We build industry leading technology to power a balanced, sustainable and resilient marketplace that efficiently meets customer demand, incentivizes shoppers, and offers a widening range of high quality services. Our engineering teams are world-class experts in systems, algorithms, machine learning, optimization and operations research, working together to drive technology innovations in areas such as routing, matching, pricing, forecasting, incentives that enable best product experiences for our customers and shoppers.

Given the scale and growth of our platform and the combinatorial explosion of logistics possibilities, our system needs to handle billions of computations in real time and provide optimal solutions that lead to the most efficient and reliable way of fulfilling customer orders. We rely heavily on state-of-the-art data infrastructure and online inference architectures paired with best-in-class modeling techniques and methodologies so as to adapt to the dynamic nature of customer demand, available inventory, and shopper supply. As a technologist, joining our team means working on endless fun and challenging problems with a brilliant team that has been central to, and is playing an increasingly critical role to the growth of the Instacart platform.

About The Team

A few project examples: Services & Pricing, Logistics, Dynamic Pricing, Marketplace Balancing
Imagine an on-line shopping experience where delivery options and pricing are dynamically constructed to boost your shopping experience.
We aim to bring such a personalized delivery experience to online shopping. The goal is to let people order whatever they want, whenever it's convenient, for a price that fits their budget.
Machine learning models play a major role in predicting the ETA of delivering an order to any user, the capacity of each delivery option based on real-time shopper supply, and the corresponding pricing of each delivery option.
We work on improving all these models on Instacart to present the most desirable shopping experience for each user, in order to retain loyal customers and gain new customers.
Logistics works on a range of interesting and challenging problems, from making sure orders are fulfilled efficiently and on-time to helping customers decide what to buy.
Dynamic Pricing owns how we pay for work. We pay multi-billion dollars annually to shoppers and it is the vast majority of the spend needed to run our business.
We're working to overcome big challenges, including adjusting in real-time to local supply and demand conditions across multiple countries, supporting massive scale for our optimization engines, and figuring out how to structure pay for next-generation fulfillment models and products.
Marketplace balancing is aimed to optimize Instacart's demand and supply distributions through forecasting, decision making, and balancing levers. Typical forecasting projects include: building ML based forecasting models, tracking real-time demand/supply events, and building scalable forecasting pipelines and systems.
The decision-making system consumes demand/supply forecasts and makes coordinated and optimized decisions on when, where and how to apply particular balancing levers to match demand and supply.
The charter of the balancing levers includes the development, measurement, and optimization of various demand shaping techniques, and supply acquisition, promotion, and engagement channels.

You'll be one of the first 5 employees at a fully-funded and commercially-flourishing startup. Together, we'll reinvent therapy and change the mental health of millions. Details below!

About Us:

Aware Healthcare is turning therapy from an art to a science. We're a venture-backed startup, on a mission to create the highest quality mental health care franchise in the world.

Every day, 100 million Americans struggle with a mental health issue, yet only 10% are receiving care based on science. That's why we're building a new mental health care system driven by data, where patients receive individualized care, clinicians deliver proven treatments, and insurance pays for outcomes not sessions.

While the rest of our industry is optimizing for quantity, we are laser focused on quality. Leveraging our data platform, we recently landed contracts with 6 of the top 7 insurance companies, which unlock access to 111M Americans and pay higher rates than any competitor.

We have raised $5.7mm from top executives at Google, PayPal, Lyft, and AirBnB and investors who previously funded Square, Instacart, Twilio, GrubHub, StitchFix, OpenDoor, and SpaceX. We were founded in 2020 by AJ Goldstein (previously early at Calm and Oura) and are based in San Francisco CA. You can learn more about Aware here: https://www.awarehc.com/

Summary:
The first high-frequency, commission-free sports betting exchange, recently closed a $6m seed round from YC, Lux, Soma, Paul Graham, Joe Montana, Innospark, the founders of Instacart and Dropbox, and many other top angels and funds
Looking for quant traders and researchers, designers, SWEs, marketing, BD, operations, and product roles to work out of our NY office
Salaries at the top of benchmarks, with significant equity ownership and generous benefits
Founders are recent Harvard grads with quant experience at Jane Street and BoA and years of experience as sharp sports bettors
$300B annually bet on sports in the US and the size of the market is rapidly growing given the number of states legalizing sports betting
Currently the only way to bet is with retail sportsbooks which have egregious margins, discriminatory and inefficient practices, and a stale betting experience
Novig is a sports betting exchange that guarantees users the best lines by allowing them to bet directly against friends or the market, rather than against the house, making the betting experience more efficient, fair, and, most importantly, profitable

What will you do?

With our focus on research and technology, you will be working on optimizing our low-latency systems that will support the transformation of sports betting. You will apply state-of-the-art technologies used in modern securities exchanges to enforce transparent and efficient market practices in the future of sports betting. Depending on your familiarity with different levels of our tech stack, you may work on optimizations within our hardware, data layer, networking, or application logic.

What are we looking for?

We value candidates with expressed interest in sports, markets, and computer architecture. We work on problems across the stack, from low-level hardware optimizations to high-level design of concurrent algorithms. You are someone who is passionate about the complexities of computer science who can contribute toward helping us build a robust, scalable sports trading marketplace.

Requirements:
Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science or a related field
5+ years of experience developing distributed systems with cloud-based architecture
Expertise in networks and data engineering is preferred
Strong leadership, problem-solving, and communication skills
Comfortable working independently and with small teams covering large surface area

Who is Novig?

At Novig, we are building the first high-frequency, commission-free sports trading platform in the US — essentially the NASDAQ of betting.

We guarantee bettors the best odds and eliminates the need for traditional sportsbooks. We do this by enabling users to bet directly against friends or the market, rather than against the house, making the betting experience more efficient, fair, and, most importantly, profitable.

Novig's founders, Jacob and Kelechi, are recent Harvard grads with experience at Jane St & BoA who started Novig with the believe that a commission-free P2P exchange model will replace the exploitative and unprofitable betting model of traditional sportsbooks. They themselves were sophisticated sports bettors who grew increasingly frustrated by the latency, discriminatory practices, monotony, and non-profitability of the retail sportsbook betting experience.

As the regulatory landscape evolves in the United States, Novig is positioned to become a leading innovator in sports betting with our unique focus on research and technology.

How does Novig approach compensation?

We are big believers in providing excellent compensation to everyone on the team as we build the future of sports betting.
We offer salaries at the top of the benchmarks you'd find for senior roles at big name companies
We provide equity to all employees regardless of role. We are looking for people who can grow with us as we scale our team and product, and we think it's important for all employees, especially our first few teammates, to have significant equity in the company so you have skin in the game and our incentives are aligned.

What benefits does Novig offer?

We are embarking on an ambitious journey and are committed to providing generous benefits, even at this early stage.
Robust health, dental, and vision plans, covering 100% of health premiums and 90% of dental and vision premiums
Generous 401(k) plan, matching up to 4% of base salary
Health Savings Account (HSA) with $1,080 annual company contributions

You'll be one of the first 5 employees at a fully-funded and commercially-flourishing startup. Together, we'll reinvent therapy and change the mental health of millions. Details below!

About Us:

Aware Healthcare is turning therapy from an art to a science. We're a venture-backed startup, on a mission to create the highest quality mental health care franchise in the world.

Every day, 100 million Americans struggle with a mental health issue, yet only 10% are receiving care based on science. That's why we're building a new mental health care system driven by data, where patients receive individualized care, clinicians deliver proven treatments, and insurance pays for outcomes not sessions.

While the rest of our industry is optimizing for quantity, we are laser focused on quality. Leveraging our data platform, we recently landed contracts with 6 of the top 7 insurance companies, which unlock access to 111M Americans and pay higher rates than any competitor.

We have raised $5.7mm from top executives at Google, PayPal, Lyft, and AirBnB and investors who previously funded Square, Instacart, Twilio, GrubHub, StitchFix, OpenDoor, and SpaceX. We were founded in 2020 by AJ Goldstein (previously early at Calm and Oura) and are based in San Francisco, CA. You can learn more about Aware here: https://www.awarehc.com/

…

The Technical Challenge:

We are building the largest digital dataset of an individual's mental health using data from their personal IoT devices (e.g. smartphones, wearables, laptops, smart homes, connected cars).

To do this, we need to build scalable and reliable systems to ingest and process that data, and create innovative user experiences for therapists and patients to get better sooner.

100 million people are currently struggling with a mental health issue in the US alone. This is a problem with a huge scale, and even bigger engineering opportunity.

These are the 4 main challenges your teams will be tackling:
Data Engineering: Processing, structuring, and storing data from patients' connected devices (e.g. smartphones, wearables), for Data Scientists to build models upon them.
Product Development: Meticulously designing and developing the user experience for the patients and providers using our products to save and change lives.
Integrations: Building new integrations that allow high-quality data to be consistently sourced and aggregated from smartphones, wearables, and more.
Security and Compliance: Ensuring Aware's platform is HIPAA compliant, and securing very personal data with best-in-class data privacy protocols.

At this stage, we're looking for a rockstar. Someone ready to hit the ground running with our existing web applications and build entire new ones from scratch.

Bigeye,Senior Backend Engineer,"San Francisco, CA","Senior Backend Engineer, Bigeye, San Francisco, CA, Remote, Medical, Vision, Dental, Hide job, 2 months ago, 1 applicant","The Company

At Bigeye, our mission is to help our customers make magic with data.

We built some of the most widely adopted tools at companies like Uber and saw how swift teams move when they have a great data toolchain. Now, Bigeye is building best-of-breed tools for analysts, data scientists, and data engineers on data teams everywhere.

At Bigeye, we are re-envisioning data quality with the premier data observability platform. In less than 15 minutes, customers instrument data sources with thousands of data quality metrics and anomaly detection algorithms that proactively alert them to issues. With Bigeye, data teams prevent customer-facing data outages, save expensive engineering hours, and build greater faith in the data.

We’re growing: In 3 years since founding, Bigeye has raised $66M in funding from prominent investors like Sequoia, Coatue, and Costanoa. In that time, Bigeye has built a customer base of data teams from organizations like Instacart, Udacity, and Clubhouse, and more than doubled the size of the team.

The Team

You’ll be an early engineer on our team, joining a powerhouse team of engineers, product designers, data scientists, and enterprise sales folks. You’ll not only help us build products that customers love using, you’ll help us build a team that people love working on.

The Work

Today, we’re focused on one of the most painful aspects of DataOps: observability and outages.

Most teams still discover data outages – duplicated, missing, and unexpected data – after they impact application features, dashboards, ML models, and ultimately their stakeholders. We’re building a data observability platform to monitor their data content and alert them early so they can triage and react instantly.

What you’ll be doing
Design and develop product solutions to address the needs of our earliest customers
Keep Bigeye reliable and performant as customers deploy it on hundred of tables, thousands of columns, and billions of rows
Design and contribute to an engineering platform that keeps us iterating rapidly and efficiently
Hone the team’s engineering practices and shared toolset
Collaborate with the design and data science teams to research, development, and implement solutions

We’re currently working with
Java
Python
REST APIs
RabbitMQ
Protobuf
Datadog
Docker

What You Bring
5+ years of experience in Java (or another typed language).
Experience working within a Service Oriented Architecture.
Experience designing, building and aiding in a user-facing product
A desire to learn and grow as an engineer
Proven passion for uncovering and addressing the real customer problem. We think this is the core of a successful product.
Excitement about being an early engineer. You’ll be defining our engineering practices and helping us build a cutting-edge team.
Clear and straightforward communication. We’ll be building some intricate products as a team, so clarity matters.

Bigeye aims to treat real problems for real data teams using boring technology. Success comes from building great products that address real obstacles for customers, not from satisfying our own technical curiosities.

Salary Expectations
Base salary of $160,000-$205,000, depending on experience
Curious about how we determined this range? Ask about our process!
Benefits
Generous salary and equity opportunity
Remote first - Live where you want in the US
Medical, Dental and Vision to keep you healthy
Health and Wellness package
401k plan to help you save for the future
Generous PTO to have fun
Receive an elite technology package to make work easier
Stipend to make your home office more comfortable

Bigeye is an Equal Opportunity Employer and we will not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any sort. We do celebrate diversity and believe experience comes in different forms; many techniques are transferable; and passion goes a long way. Diversity in our team makes for more creative thinking, and ultimately a better product and company culture.

Even more important than your resume is a clear demonstration of impact, initiative, and the aptitude to thrive in a collaborative environment. Bigeye aspires to have an inclusive work environment; so if you are hard working & good at what you do then please come as you are.

,,,,"About Veho

Veho's mission is to revolutionize the world of package delivery by creating exceptional experiences for customers and drivers.

For too long, parcel delivery companies have focused solely on efficiencies and cost-management. Veho focuses on the end-customer. As the first technology company of its kind, Veho replaces the old delivery trucks with a platform of crowdsourced drivers and a network of hyper-local delivery stations. We partner with some of the most recognized consumer brands such as Warby Parker and Hello Fresh to provide an incredible experience with every delivery, and give customers control on how, when and where their package is delivered.

Customers LOVE us. Despite growing at a record-speed over the past two years, we maintain an incredibly high customer satisfaction rating of 4.9/5 stars, and an unprecedented on-time delivery rate of 99.9% - far above every other company in the country.

In short, we are building the logistics platform of the future.

Veho is backed by former top executives and board members at Uber, FedEx, UPS, eBay and Amazon, three former public company CEOs, early investors in Lyft and Instacart, as well as prominent venture capital firms General Catalyst, Tiger Global, and Softbank. We are a team of leaders who are passionate about building an incredible company that will change the face of this industry.

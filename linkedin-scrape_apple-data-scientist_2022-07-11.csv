DESCRIPTION

Amazon is the 4th most popular site in the US (http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/US). Our product search engine is one of the most heavily used services in the world, indexes billions of products, and serves hundreds of millions of customers world-wide. We are working on a new AI-first initiative to re-architect and reinvent the way we do search through the use of extremely large scale next-generation deep learning techniques. Our goal is to make step function improvements in the use of advanced Machine Learning (ML) on very large scale datasets, specifically through the use of aggressive systems engineering and hardware accelerators. This is a rare opportunity to develop cutting edge ML solutions and apply them to a problem of this magnitude. Some exciting questions that we expect to answer over the next few years include:
Can a focus on compilers and custom hardware help us accelerate model training and reduce hardware costs?
Can combining supervised multi-task training with unsupervised training help us to improve model accuracy?
Can we transfer our knowledge of the customer to every language and every locale ?
This is a unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor, shape, and build the next-generation of Amazon Search. We are looking for exceptional scientists and ML engineers who are passionate about innovation and impact, and want to work in a team with a startup culture within a larger organization.

DESCRIPTION

AT-SEA is seeking an exceptionally talented person who wants to explore the future of fulfillment through simulation. As Advanced Technology explores new approaches to automate transformations within the warehouse environment there is a distinct need to simulate complex systems in a realistic manner to determine if the design parameters will deliver the performance expected at scale. As physical testing begins to replace assumptions with data, the simulations will reveal whether there is a risk to the system not delivering expected performance. As improvements and mitigations are contemplated, the simulations will reveal which hold the greatest promise. Most of this work is expected to be conducted using industry standard tools such as the FlexSim, but there will also be opportunities to build custom simulations in python to address other questions. Your work in this high-pace environment will be critical in accelerating the speed of development by making the most out of available data and avoiding the construction of systems that can’t deliver the needed performance.

Key job responsibilities
Build complex discrete event simulations to compare potential solutions and accelerate the design of integrated systems.
Investigate the sensitivities of designs to perturbation.
Quantify the implications of emergent data and observations.
Explore the potential of proposed improvements and the potential impacts of other proposed changes to system design.

Apply a breadth of experience from practical application of data science techniques and tools to solve difficult business problems.
Design and implement scalable and reliable approaches to extract the best information possible from the data.
Make trade-offs between methods and apply best practices to validate your solutions.
Work with business stakeholders, other scientists, and engineers to identify data requirements for a given problem.
Use a data-driven approach to evaluate existing and new technologies required for a solution.
Write clear and factually correct documents, including substantial data and analytical components.
Explain technical concepts and assumptions to non-technical audiences.
Develop metrics to quantify the benefits of a solution and influence project resources.
Audit metric data and use it to measure project progress and success.
Help your team and the business evolve by actively participating in discussions, team planning, office hours, and metric reviews.

DESCRIPTION

AT-SEA is seeking an exceptionally talented person who wants to explore the future of fulfillment through simulation. As Advanced Technology explores new approaches to automate transformations within the warehouse environment there is a distinct need to simulate complex systems in a realistic manner to determine if the design parameters will deliver the performance expected at scale. As physical testing begins to replace assumptions with data, the simulations will reveal whether there is a risk to the system not delivering expected performance. As improvements and mitigations are contemplated, the simulations will reveal which hold the greatest promise. Most of this work is expected to be conducted using industry standard tools such as the FlexSim, but there will also be opportunities to build custom simulations in python to address other questions. Your work in this high-pace environment will be critical in accelerating the speed of development by making the most out of available data and avoiding the construction of systems that can’t deliver the needed performance.

Key job responsibilities
Build highly complex discrete event simulations to compare potential solutions and accelerate the design of systems of systems.
Conduct complex experiments in simulation space to investigate tradeoffs and relationships between performance variables.
Investigate the sensitivities of designs to perturbation.
Quantify the implications of emergent data and observations.
Explore the potential of proposed improvements and the potential impacts of other proposed changes to system design.
Take the lead on large projects that span multiple teams. The problems you solve are ambiguous, requiring both technical and domain expertise. You deliver significant benefits to business with minimal assistance.
Understand challenges in your teams’ business area, the applicability of relevant data science disciplines, and interactions among systems. You influence your team’s technical and business strategy by making insightful contributions to team priorities and approach.
Make solutions simpler. You optimize connected systems using their dynamics. You improve the consistency and integration between your team’s solutions and the work being done by related teams.
Improve the work done by others, either via a collaborative effort or by increasing their scientific knowledge, using specialized tools or advanced techniques. You lead and actively participate in scientific reviews for your team and others.
Communicate your ideas effectively to achieve the right outcome for your team and customer including when to make appropriate trade-offs. You harmonize discordant views and lead the resolution of contentious issues (build consensus).
Actively participate in the hiring process and improve the skills and knowledge of others via mentoring.

DESCRIPTION

Would you like to help us build the next-generation cloud services that will power the largest managed infrastructure in the world? We’re hiring a Data Scientist for AWS Compute Optimizer team within Amazon AWS Insights. Our service uses large amounts of data combined with machine learning (ML) and push the boundaries of scale, availability, and performance, while maintaining the highest standards for security and operational excellence.

AWS Compute Optimizer helps you choose optimal configurations for three types of AWS resources: Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EBS volumes, and AWS Lambda functions, based on your utilization data. By applying the knowledge drawn from Amazon’s own experience running diverse workloads in the cloud, Compute Optimizer identifies workload patterns and recommends optimal AWS resources. Compute Optimizer analyzes the configuration and resource utilization of your workload to identify dozens of defining characteristics, for example, if a workload is CPU-intensive, if it exhibits a daily pattern, or if a workload accesses local storage frequently. The service processes these characteristics and identifies the hardware resource required by the workload. Compute Optimizer infers how the workload would have performed on various hardware platforms (e.g. Amazon EC2 instances types) or using different configurations (e.g. Amazon EBS volume IOPS settings, and AWS Lambda function memory sizes) to offer recommendations.

You will take on challenges in providing recommendations based on billions of metric records available for various customers and their use cases. You will be empowered to think big, invent on behalf of our customers, make judgment calls and find elegant solutions to hard problems.
